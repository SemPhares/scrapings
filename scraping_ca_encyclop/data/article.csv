Agricultural Stabilization Board;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/agricultural-stabilization-board;Agricultural Stabilization Board, established under the federal Agricultural Stabilization Act of 1958, is intended to provide income support to producers in periods of depressed market returns.;"
	  Agricultural Stabilization Board, established under the federal Agricultural Stabilization Act of 1958, is intended to provide income support to producers in periods of depressed market returns. Funds for board operations come from an annual appropriation through the budget of the federal minister of agriculture. The board has 2 means of stabilizing the prices of designated agricultural products: it may offer to purchase any commodity deemed to be in excess supply; or it may make a deficiency payment to producers of a product, the market price of which is below some designated minimum support price. The board may be, under the terms of the legislation, assisted in its work by an advisory committee of farmers or representatives of farm organizations, all of whom are appointed by the federal minister of agriculture.


	  Under the original Agricultural Stabilization Act (which replaced the 1944 Agricultural Prices Support Act), the support price for designated commodities was set at 80% of the average price for the preceding 10 years. The Act was amended in 1975 to provide a guaranteed price of 90% of the 5-year average weighted price for cattle, hogs, sheep, industrial milk and cream, corn and soybeans, and for oats and barley produced outside the Canadian Wheat Board designated area of the Prairies. In 1985 the Act was amended to allow the Minister of Agriculture to enter into tripartite agreements with provinces and producers for price stabilization programs.

Agriculture and Food Policy;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/agriculture-and-food-policy;Federal agricultural policy is intended to serve national economic and political goals as well as the interests of those directly involved in and affected by Canadian agriculture - primarily producers, food processors, distributors, retailers and consumers.;"
	 Federal agricultural policy is intended to serve national economic and political goals as well as the interests of those directly involved in and affected by Canadian agriculture - primarily producers, food processors, distributors, retailers and consumers. The Task Force Report on Agriculture, official publications such as Canadian Agriculture in the Seventies (1969), A Food Strategy for Canada (1977) and the 4-volume Orientation of Canadian Agriculture (1977) identify the national goals as economic development, rising and stable incomes, full employment and harmonious international and federal-provincial relations. Specific agricultural goals include stable and fair producer returns, adequate supplies of high-quality, nutritious food at stable and reasonable prices, and rural development and resource conservation. In addition to these traditional goals, new objectives entered Canadian agricultural policy in the 1990s. Agriculture Canada's 1989 Growing Together document and their 1994 Vision on Future Directions for Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food stressed the agriculture sector's need to be more self-reliant and market-oriented, less dependent on government financial support, and more internationally competitive. At the same time, long-standing goals of a safe and high-quality food supply and financial security for producers were reaffirmed.


	 From Confederation until the late 1950s federal agricultural policy was designed to secure Canada's control over the West, and to produce food for Canada, its trading partners and war allies. In the years following Confederation, agricultural expansion was encouraged by immigration and settlement of the West and the Department Of Agriculture began its existing program of scientific research and development and experimental farms. Governments encouraged the production and export of grain. The freight rates at which grain grown on the prairies moved to export markets were fixed as early as 1897 in the Crow's Nest Pass Agreement. But the lack of competition in the marketing of grain and the monopolistic trading practices of the private grain and elevator companies troubled farmers. Their calls for regulation of the grain-handling system - including government inspection and standards, public ownership and operation of elevators, and a government marketing agency - were gradually heeded, leading to the contemporary system of grain handling and marketing.


	 During the First World War, in order to prevent speculation on wheat prices, the government established the Board of Grain Supervisors to market the 1917 and 1918 crops. It was succeeded by the Canadian Wheat Board, which handled the 1919 crop. When the Board was subsequently terminated, producers established their own co-operative pools to handle and sell prairie grain (see Co-operative Movement). The collapse of these pools in 1930 led to the permanent creation of the Canadian Wheat Board in 1935. It was given monopoly authority over the marketing of prairie wheat in 1943, and between 1949 and 1973, over oats and barley.


	 The Great Depression forced governments to consider problems of agriculture itself, particularly low and unstable incomes. Severe drought and crop failures, in conjunction with depressed farm prices, led to the federal Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act (PFRA, 1935) and the Prairie Farm Assistance Act (PFAA, 1939). Under the PFRA, federal and provincial governments co-operated in programs to rehabilitate agricultural land, develop farm water supplies, provide community pastures, and resettle individuals from drought-stricken lands to more arable sites. The first 3 aspects of the PFRA continue today. The PFAA provided minimal payments to marginal farmers experiencing below normal crop yields.


	 During the Second World War, agriculture again became important for its contribution to national objectives. The needs of the agricultural community and producers' concerns were of secondary importance; the emphasis was on pursuing Canada's war effort by filling the food requirements of Canada's wartime allies and curbing domestic inflation of consumer prices. Even so, a number of programs inaugurated during this period remain in effect today, including the Feed Grain Freight Assistance program (1941), the Farm Improvement Loans Act (1944), and the concept of government subsidies to support commodity prices and producer incomes.


	 The Feed Grain Freight Assistance program stimulated livestock production by subsidizing the transportation and storage of feed grains from the prairie provinces to eastern Canada and BC. Subsidies and price supports were used to encourage the production of essential commodities and to offset the price ceilings that held down product prices in spite of rising costs. The government's recognition of agriculture's contribution to the war effort led it to provide some guarantee of income protection in the postwar period. The Agricultural Prices Support Board (1944) was authorized to prescribe prices, to purchase and sell products, and to pay producers the difference between the prescribed and selling prices. And finally, the Farm Improvement Loans Act (1944) made intermediate and short-term loans available to farmers.


	 Agricultural policy in the 1950s and 1960s was oriented to increasing the productivity and efficiency of agriculture, and thereby ostensibly raising and stabilizing commodity prices. The Farm Credit Act (1959) made credit available and encouraged the mechanization and growth in size of farms. The Agricultural Stabilization Board (1958), the successor to the Agricultural Prices Support Board, gave farmers a measure of protection from the fluctuating competitive marketing system by guaranteeing a base price for selected farm commodities. Federal expenditures to support and stabilize prices of dairy products expanded significantly in the 1970s, accounting for 80% of federal price and income maintenance payments, and became permanent with the creation of the Canadian Dairy Commission in 1966 (see National Farmers Union). A joint provincial-federal crop insurance program begun in 1959 reduced the financial impact of natural disasters. Federal-provincial co-operation in the Agriculture Rehabilitation and Development Act (1961), later renamed the Agricultural and Rural Development Act (1960), and the Fund for Rural Economic Development (1966) was targeted at enhancing the viability of rural communities through improved resource use and retraining to facilitate the exit of marginal farmers to other jobs. And the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act (1957) authorized the Canadian Wheat Board to make advance payments to producers on a portion of their farm-stored grain.


	 Federal programs prior to the 1970s interfered as little as possible with the competitive market system of pricing. Farmers received market prices; the stabilization programs shored up farm incomes when prices fell below average, but did so at levels that minimally distorted the operation of the market system. While the Canadian Wheat Board instituted order in grain marketing and equity in pricing, grain prices themselves were established by changing world market factors. Provincial governments had allowed producers to pool their products and sell them through provincial marketing boards or co-operatives which could negotiate higher prices. When the federal legislation to permit national marketing boards was declared unconstitutional (the Natural Products Marketing Reference, 1937), the federal government passed the Agricultural Products Marketing Act (1949). Provincial boards could be delegated federal authority to regulate the outward movement of commodities into export and interprovincial trade but could not restrict the inflow of commodities from other provinces or countries, and were thus unable to control completely the supply, and therefore, the price of the regulated commodity.


	 The unusually turbulent markets and a serious cost-price squeeze for many farmers in the 1970s led provincial governments to initiate and the federal government to extend income maintenance programs. Québec, BC and Ontario passed comprehensive stabilization legislation and several other provinces undertook to protect hog and cattle producers from unstable markets and depressed prices. The federal government amended the Agricultural Stabilization Act in 1975 and passed the Western Grain Stabilization Act in 1976. The former guaranteed government support of the prices of industrial milk and cream, corn, soybeans, slaughter cattle, hogs, sheep and oats and barley raised outside the Canadian Wheat Board region, at 90% of the previous 5-year average. The latter stabilized the net profit from the sale of oats, barley, wheat, canola, flaxseed and rye. Along with the crop insurance program, these income protection measures consumed almost 50% of federal agricultural spending and meant that most commodities were protected.


	 The most innovative policy in the 1970s allowed producers to fix and determine the price of commodities (see commodity trading). The Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (1972) authorized 4 national marketing agencies - the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency (1972), the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency (1973), the Canadian Chicken Marketing Agency (1979) and the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency (1986). The virtual exclusion of imports of supply-managed products, allowed under the international trading rules of the General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade (GATT), reserved the Canadian domestic consumer market for Canadian egg and poultry producers. Supply management had been implemented earlier in the dairy industry.


	 Between 1970 and 1972, a market-sharing quota system was created that attempted to balance industrial milk and cream supplies with domestic demand; in conjunction with import controls (in place since 1951) and federal subsidies, it has significantly raised and stabilized dairy farmers' incomes. This policy changed considerably in 1973 and after 1976 placed a ceiling price on feed grain for eastern Canadian buyers. The feed grain freight assistance program ended 1 July 1995 and the Canadian Livestock Feed Bureau wound up.


	 By the 1980s, there was widespread commitment at both levels of government to increase farmers' bargaining power by direct intervention in the marketplace through production controls and administered pricing. Although federal expenditures on agriculture were twice those of the provinces, several provinces were no longer willing to leave agricultural policy primarily to the federal government. In Québec, following the 1976 provincial election of the Parti Québécois, the pursuit of self-sufficiency in foodstuffs witnessed a growing regulatory and expenditure presence on the part of the Québec government. The Québec agrifood sector was supported by 4 pillars - income stabilization, provision of credit, Crop Insurance and regulated marketing - founded on both provincial and national legislation. However, whereas in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the Government of Canada accounted for two-thirds of total net expenditures on Québec agriculture, by the mid-1990s, it was the Québec government that did so.


	 The 1980s witnessed significant changes in programs for Canada's grains and oilseeds sector. Following a protracted and highly divisive debate in the prairie farm community, the Canadian government eliminated the Crow's Nest freight rates in 1983. Although the Western Grain Transportation Act provided for continuing government subsidies to the railways to defray their costs of transporting prairie grain to export markets, the farmers' right to receive freight rate assistance ""in perpetuity"" ended, and they were obliged to assume an increasing proportion of these freight costs.


	 Other changes in government programs were occasioned by the very difficult financial circumstances in the prairie community for most of the 1980s. The ""grain trade war"" in the mid- and late-1980s between the US and the European Community caused Canadian grain prices to plummet. The prairie farming community, strapped by large debt and unprecedentedly high interest rates, sank into a depression whose scale paralleled that of the 1930s. Payments from the Western Grain Stabilization Act were low and continued to decline. The Government of Canada rallied to assist prairie grain farmers with the billion-dollar Special Canada Grains program in 1986-87 and it absorbed $400 million of the Farm Credit Corporation's debt. The Agricultural Credit Corporation of Saskatchewan also went heavily into debt in an effort not to force farmers off the land.


	 Two developments meant these appreciable government payments to farmers could not be sustained indefinitely. The first was the worsening fiscal situation of provincial and national governments whose high deficits were an increasing political issue. In an effort to reduce its own financial responsibility for securing and stabilizing farmers' incomes, Ottawa reformed safety net programs in the grains and oilseeds sector to require producers and provinces to assume more of the costs. Two new programs were introduced in 1991 to support grain farmers' incomes.


	 The first, the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan, insured individual farmers' gross revenues from particular commodities in the short run. GRIP offered protection from natural hazards or from market risks beyond the control of producers. Unlike the earlier Western Grain Stabilization Act, provincial governments contributed funds to the plan that matched those of the Government of Canada. As with the WGSA, producers also contributed premiums. The second program, entitled the Net Income Stabilization Account, enabled a farmer to build up a fund to draw upon when his/her income fell below a specified figure. NISA marked a shift away from programs designed to stabilize farmers' returns for individual agricultural commodities to stabilizing the farmer's income from the whole farm enterprise. NISA was financially supported by contributions from the federal and provincial governments and the farmer.


	 The second catalyst to agricultural policy change was evidence that industrial nations' protection of their domestic producers was creating serious tensions in international trading relations. Given the importance of export markets for Canada's grain, beef and pork sectors, the Canadian government was disturbed by growing protectionism in US trade policy throughout the 1980s. Successful efforts by American domestic interests in 1984 to limit Canadian penetration of the US pork and hog markets, combined with trade disputes over a number of other food and fish products, were an important catalyst to the Canadian government seeking clearer trading rules and a bilateral dispute resolution mechanism under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US. Implemented in January 1989, the FTA was broadened to include Mexico in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. These regional agreements have increased Canadian-US interdependence in agrifood trade. In 1984, 30% of Canadian agrifood exports went to the US; by 1993, the figure was 55% owing to increased exports of live animals, beef and beverages. US imports into Canada rose from 55% of total Canadian agrifood imports in 1984 to 61% in 1993. The Canadian success in penetrating US markets continues to be resisted by domestic American interests; Canada was forced to accept a volume on its wheat exports to the US in 1994-95.


	 The importance of world markets for Canada's grains and oilseeds sector led it to join the Cairns' Group of agriculture exporting nations, which, with US leadership, launched the Uruguay Round of negotiations on GATT in 1986. The objective was to liberalize agricultural trade and open domestic agricultural markets to foreign competition. These multilateral negotiations were extremely difficult for Canada. On the one hand, Canada sought to open foreign markets to Canadian grains and oilseeds by new rules prohibiting export subsidies. The European Community and the US had successfully subsidized their grain exports to undercut Canada in grain-importing nations. On the other hand, Canadian negotiators were anxious to retain protection for domestic poultry, egg, and dairy producers by maintaining the right to restrict the volume of imports when supplies were managed domestically.


	 The GATT Agreement that was reached in December 1993 and went into effect in 1996 requires all countries to reduce their export subsidies, allow more imports, and cut their aggregate support for domestic producers. Canada failed in its endeavour to maintain volume controls on supply-managed products and was forced to accept more imported dairy and poultry products. However, high tariffs on dairy and poultry imports in the medium term give the sectors time to adjust to the future reality of lower tariffs and more competition from imported products.


	 For Canada's grain and oilseeds sectors, the modest reduction in permissible export subsidies offered the prospect of better access to foreign markets even while it imperilled their own freight subsidies under the Western Grain Transportation Act. The 1995 federal Liberal budget announced an end to export grain subsidies, a decision dictated as much by budgetary restraint as by the new GATT requirements.


	 By the mid-1990s, budgetary constraints and new international trading rules had caused a significant reform of agricultural policies and altered the role of federal and provincial governments in Canada's agrifood sector. In the grains and oilseeds sector, the 1995 federal Liberal budget announced not only the termination of export freight assistance but also a 30% reduction in federal support for safety nets. A cut of the same magnitude was made in dairy price supports and their phasing out by the year 2000 announced. Earlier, cattle and hog producers, fearing a backlash in the important US market, had opted for termination of their stabilization programs.


	 The Government of Canada's share of total agrifood spending in 1994-95 was 55%, down from 64.5% in 1988-89. Provincial spending, especially in provinces like Québec and Saskatchewan, had risen to make up the shortfall. Expenditure cuts to agricultural research, cost recovery initiatives in food inspection, elimination of duplication and overlap in federal and provincial programs and regulations cumulatively undermined the federal government's leadership role and Agriculture and Agri-food Canada's capacity to devise national programs. By 1996, in place of one national farm ""safety net"" for the grains and oilseeds sector, the decision was taken to allow provincial variations in crop insurance, whole farm stabilization (NISA or GRIP or something else) and provincial companion program coverage.


	 As the 21st century begins, issues of export trade promotion, market development and international competitiveness are at the fore in Canadian agricultural policy. The traditional producer-centred focus has shifted to one which emphasizes a partnership between governments and all segments of the agrifood industry, with each assuming its share of financial responsibility for research, food inspection, and trade and market development. Processing activities that add value to bulk commodities, diversification into nontraditional commodities, and nonfood uses of commodities are highlighted as the means to secure viable rural communities, a sustainable resource base and farm financial security.


	 Federal and provincial governments share jurisdiction for agriculture, with federal legislation paramount in the event of a conflict. Authority over marketing is divided: the federal government regulates export and interprovincial marketing, while the provincial governments legislate marketing within their borders. At the provincial level, agrifood policy is almost entirely the work of the department of agriculture. In many provinces, provincial agriculture departments have been renamed to reflect their additional mandate for rural development and for agriculture, food, and the fishery. At the national level, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada continues to be the central ministry for agrifood issues.


	 On matters of agricultural trade, which are of increasing importance for Canadian agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada works closely with the minister responsible for international trade, who has ultimate responsibility for trade policy. A number of agencies and boards delegated responsibilities for specific commodities report to the minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food: the National Farm Products Council (appointed by the minister and responsible for supervising the national chicken, turkey, egg, and broiler hatching egg marketing agencies); the Canadian Dairy Commission; the Farm Credit Corporation; the Canadian Wheat Board; the Canadian Grain Commission; and the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration. The minister responsible for national transportation supervises the rail and water grain transportation system.


	 With both levels of government exercising jurisdiction over agriculture, provincial and federal agriculture ministers have endeavoured to co-operate with one another in formulating and implementing agricultural policy. This co-operative relationship was sorely tested by federal fiscal retrenchment initiatives in the 1990s, as provinces like Saskatchewan that historically relied upon a strong federal fiscal role complained of Ottawa's failure to assume its proper responsibilities. Competitive federalism characterizes the federal government's relationship with both Québec and Alberta.


	 Québec agriculture ministers, supported by Québec's farm union, the Union des producteurs agricoles, both seek to reduce the Government of Canada's role in Québec agriculture. Rather than national programs applying in Québec, they have been highly successful in their quest to reduce the federal role to one of transferring funds to Québec City to finance provincially designed and implemented agrifood programs. Québec stands apart from the federal government in its degree of continuing state assistance for its agriculture sector. At the other end of the continuum is Alberta, resisting federal initiatives that run contrary to its objective of a small government presence in agriculture.


	 Farm groups have traditionally been a part of the agricultural policy community; no agrifood policy is made without their being consulted. This consultative practice intensified during the late 1980s and 1990s as the Government of Canada and provincial governments sought producers' advice and consent to agricultural policy reforms. Producers' policy role in certain sectors, notably in the supply-managed dairy and poultry sectors, goes beyond consultation to include the exercise of significant delegated powers. Relationships between agricultural ministries and farm unions are even closer at the provincial level than at the national level, especially in provinces like Saskatchewan and Québec. However, the influence of producer organizations on government policy, especially national agrifood policy, waned over the past decade. This decline in influence is partly due to ideological divisions and organizational fragmentation in the farm community. It is also due to governments' desire to build closer links with other segments of the food chain - notably, processors, further processors, distributors, and traders - in an effort to maximize the sector's market competitiveness.


	 Criticisms of Canadian agricultural policy vary over time, and largely rest on governments' perceived neglect of important problems or their failure to achieve an appropriate balance among the competing economic, social and political goals that underlie agricultural policy. For some, including most agricultural economists, agricultural policy should be concerned only with economic goals and maximizing overall national welfare. For others, notably many in the agrifood industry itself, agricultural policy must balance an efficient agricultural sector with social objectives like maintaining the family farm and preserving rural communities. Nor, they would argue, can one ignore political purposes, including the contribution made to national unity by policies designed to ensure equitable treatment of producers and agrifood interests in every region.


	 A persistent complaint throughout the 1970s and 1980s was that governments were preoccupied with producers' concerns to the neglect of consumers' interests. The focus of much of this criticism has been the national marketing agencies in the poultry and dairy sectors. Charges levied at these monopolistic agencies are that they raise consumer food costs unduly, allow inefficient farmers to persist in the sector, and bar young farmers from entering the poultry and dairy industries by inflating quota values and thus raising the cost of farming operations. Interprovincial tensions have developed as provinces with growing populations seek to increase their share of the available market, while provinces with stagnant or declining populations resist decreases in their share.


	 The tendency to protect local consumer markets for local producers distresses the federal government, which advocates the geographical distribution of production on the basis of comparative advantage. Following extensive discussions with all segments of the supply-managed industries, and in the wake of the recommendations of the Federal-Provincial Task Force on Orderly Marketing, the federal minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, in cooperation with his provincial counterparts, initiated several changes to allay these criticisms of poultry and dairy marketing agencies. Structural changes allow for greater representation and voting rights for nonproducer (consumer, further processor) interests on national marketing agencies. Operational changes are designed to make domestic marketing boards more flexible in responding to changing consumer preferences and market forces, as well as to allow production to shift to more cost-efficient provinces.


	 Other persistent criticisms include the failure of agricultural policy to ensure the survival of the family farm and the rural communities. The issue was particularly salient during the 1980s, when over half of the prairie farm community was seriously indebted and many, including young farmers, were forced to exit farming. The adequacy of measures taken to address the debt crisis, including farm debt review boards that mediated between the lending institution and the farmer, and the rural transition program that assisted farmers financially to retrain for a nonagricultural profession, was much debated. The success of more recent initiatives to create employment in rural areas remains to be seen. However, many in the farm community fear that governments' preoccupation with trade competitiveness and efficiency will necessitate even further consolidation and capitalization in the farm production sector, and further imperil the family farmer.


	 Among those issues that will continue to generate controversy in the agrifood policy community in the late 1990s are a host of environmental issues. These include sustainable resource use, agricultural land preservation, the use of Biotechnology, and ""right to farm"" legislation. Another unresolved source of contention is the appropriateness of single-desk seller agencies like the Canadian Wheat Board. Critics of the Wheat Board argue it is an inefficient anachronism and a restraint on producer initiative in the new era of liberalizing trade markets; advocates of the Board maintain that a monopoly export agency is more vital than ever.

	The Anti-Inflation Act was a temporary and extraordinary measure instituted by the government of Pierre Trudeau in an attempt to control high unemployment and inflation. In 1976 the federal government referred, for the opinion of the Supreme Court, two questions regarding the Act, the principal one of which was whether the Act was ultra vires the jurisdiction of the government of Canada in whole or in part. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the validity of the Act, and therefore of certain peacetime emergency powers designed to control profits, prices, dividends and salaries and to combat inflation, on the basis of the implicit emergency power (defined by Mr Justice Beetz as a concurrent and paramount power over matters normally under provincial jurisdiction) possessed by the federal government. The court held by a majority that Parliament need not make a ritual statement that a state of emergency exists as it was clear from the statute that it contemplated a serious national condition and that there was a rational basis for the legislation.

Although the program was phased out during 1978, the AIB did not cease all operations until 1979. Because of its examination of company profits, close to $323.1 million was returned to the marketplace by hundreds of companies. The wide-ranging mandate of the board was highly controversial; it examined auto, fuel-oil and gas prices, Bell Canada employee wages, insurance premiums, beef prices, etc. The board's consequent recommendations resulted in rebates, wage rollbacks and price increases. Amendments were made to the Anti-Inflation Act to ensure that prices and wages did not automatically jump when the control period (and therefore the AIB's recommendations) came to an end.

Architectural Competitions;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/architectural-competitions;An architectural competition occurs when designs are prepared by two or more architects for the same project, on the same site, at the same time. Some competitions are open, meaning that any architect within a designated area is eligible to enter.;"
 Toronto City Hall is a familiar Canadian building built as the result of an architectural competition. Completed in 1963, it was designed by the Finnish architect Viljo Revell, who won the 1958 international competition convened by the city. Over 500 architects from around the world participated. The City Hall building has become well known for its distinctive design, and the architectural competition which led to its selection has come to be viewed, in professional architectural circles, as exemplary.


	 An architectural competition occurs when designs are prepared by two or more architects for the same project, on the same site, at the same time. Some competitions are open, meaning that any architect within a designated area is eligible to enter. Others are limited, meaning that only architects who possess relevant expertise or who are recognized as outstanding designers are invited to participate. Eligibility is sometimes limited to a geographical area: thus the pool of eligible competitors may be local, regional, provincial, or even international. Sometimes the winning design is selected from the first group that is submitted. On other occasions, competitions are two-staged. In these cases, a short list of finalists is selected from the first stage, and each is asked to participate in a second, final stage. In some limited competitions with small numbers of invited competitors, and in some second stages of two-stage competitions, competitors are paid an honorarium to participate. The competition for the Toronto City Hall, for example, was open and international. It also had two stages, and second-stage competitors received a monetary prize for being selected to participate.


	 In modern times, competitions have been conducted under the auspices of professional associations of architects who have sought to ensure that the building programs and other competition documents are well organized, that the prizes and awards offered to competitors are of appropriate magnitude, that procedures are fair, and that jurors selected to adjudicate the results are well qualified. Typically, the first prize in an architectural competition is a contract to execute the winning design, but the prestige of a second or third prize is also often significant in the career of a designer who wins one. Sometimes, runner-up designs are even viewed as harbingers of future architectural possibilities which a jury has admired, but has been reluctant to choose.


	 Contemporary architectural competitions are organized by professional advisors, who assume responsibility to prepare the competition documents for competitors, to establish the procedures (for example, ensuring the anonymity of entries by all competitors during the deliberations of the jury), to nominate prospective jurors and to obtain the necessary approvals from the appropriate professional architectural associations. Juries are typically composed of a mixture of distinguished architects and representatives of the sponsor for whom the project is to be constructed.


	 The procedures that govern architectural competitions today have evolved over many years. The designs of many historic Canadian buildings were selected much less formally. One important early instance was the 1859 competition for the Parliament and related buildings in Ottawa. In this case, the competition was organized by the Department of Public Works, with the advice of the governor-general of the day, Sir Edmund Walker Head. Using pseudonyms, 17 architects submitted 33 designs to a jury comprising two senior civil servants. The winner was the team of Thomas Fuller (who later went on to become the distinguished chief architect of the young Dominion of Canada) and Chilion Jones. They were awarded the contract to execute the design of the main Parliament building. In this especially happy historical instance, the second and third prize winners were also offered building commissions. Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver were offered a contract to execute the Departmental Blocks which flank the main building, and F.W. Cumberland and W. G. Storm were offered one for a residence for the governor-general (this last, as it turns out, was not built, the already existing Rideau Hall eventually being chosen for these purposes instead).


	 In a less savoury instance, the results of an 1880 competition for a new legislative assembly building for Ontario were set aside on the grounds that all of the designs were too expensive. Instead, the contract for the design of the building was awarded to an architect from Buffalo, New York, who had been one of the jurors for the competition!


	 Over the years, other competition controversies have erupted as well, but the competition process itself has carried on. For example, over the next few decades, competitions were held for designs for legislative assembly buildings for British Columbia (1892-3), Saskatchewan (1907); (see Saskatchewan Legislative Building) and Manitoba (1913). All of these ended happily. Since the last years of the 19th century, competitions have also been held for city halls for Calgary, Edmonton (twice), Kitchener, Mississauga, Toronto (twice) and Winnipeg. In recent years, such procedures were employed to select designs for the Museum of Civilization (winner, Douglas Cardinal) and the National Gallery in Ottawa (winner, Moshe Safdie), for the Mendel Art Gallery in Saskatoon (winner, Blankstein, Coop, Gilmore & Hanna), and for a master plan for Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC (winner Erickson/Massey).


 In 1960, in one of the last of his many distinguished acts of cultural patronage, Vincent Massey convened a limited competition for the design of a new graduate college for the University of Toronto, to carry his family name. Including only 4 competitors, Massey's gesture resulted in the creation of Massey College, one of architect Ron Thom's masterpieces and a singular ornament of the campus of the University of Toronto.


	 In recent years a variant of the familiar model of the architectural competition has come into vogue, in ways which have aroused some concern in professional architectural circles. This is the so-called developer proposal call, in which a group of development proponents is invited - typically by a public or quasi-public agency - to make proposals to them for the use of a property the agency owns. Such proposals typically include both a financial offer to the agency in question and a design proposal for the use of the property in question. In such cases, architects who participate do so only at the invitation of developer proponents formally invited to participate in the call. The juries convened to assess the submissions have the responsibility to judge not only the designs proposed, but also those of the financial proposals which accompany them.


	 In more than a few recent cases the results of such proposal calls have led to charges that the merits of the designs submitted have received insufficient weight by comparison with the accompanying financial proposals. Since in such cases architects participating have been satisfactorily paid by their developer clients, it has not been possible for concerned professional associations of architects thus far to find ways to strengthen the place of design in such procedures.

Budgetary Process;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/budgetary-process;Canada's federal and provincial governments follow a budgetary process, designed to ensure control, accountability and planning in the spending of public money. ;"
Canada's federal and provincial governments follow a budgetary process, designed to ensure control, accountability and planning in the spending of public money. That process is centered around a government's department of finance, but also involves the Cabinet and members of Parliament or provincial legislatures. The process continues to evolve, according to the desires of new governments.


	 In theory, the annual preparation by the executive or Cabinet of a budget for approval by Parliament or the legislatures, allows for the exercise of popular control over spending.


	 The budget statement must include all the annual revenues and expenditures. As a planning instrument, the budget, again in theory, allows a government to analyse the revenue and spending implications of its current and proposed programs and the financial relationships among them. Federally, the budgetary process may also serve to stabilize the economy through spending measures.


	 In the Canadian government there are really two budgets – revenue and expenditure – and two budgetary processes. The revenue budgetary process culminates with the presentation of the budget speech to Parliament by the minister of finance. In it and in accompanying documentation, the minister reviews the current and projected state of the economy and the government's financial situation, announces any specific changes in tax rates and tax structures, and sometimes unveils major new spending programs.


	 Following the budget debate, the House of Commons votes to accept or reject the budget. This vote is a matter of confidence. If the revenue budget is rejected by the Commons, the government resigns and an election may be called, which happened with the minority government budgets of May 1974 and December 1979.


	 Considering the crucial importance to the ruling government of a budget speech, the process of budgetary preparation is rather odd. Traditionally, the revenue budget is prepared in strict secrecy by the minister of finance and a relatively small group of his officials. With the possible exception of the prime minister, the rest of Cabinet is seldom informed of its contents until just before the budget speech.


	 The reason for this secrecy and for the lack of consultation is that prior knowledge of a budget's contents might enable some individuals to profit unfairly at the expense of others. However, in recent years ministers of finance have acknowledged the desirability of pre-budget consultations and have begun to ease the secrecy surrounding the budget's preparation. It is now not unusual for the prime minister or the minister of finance to drop broad hints about an upcoming budget, or for their officials to reveal select details from the budget to the news media. However, budget secrecy is still the norm; when the secrets are finally and fully revealed in the minister’s budget speech in Parliament, it is a significant media event, thereby creating a major political opportunity for the government to promote its policies.


	 The preparation of the expenditure budget is much less secret, at least within the government. Tabled in the House each February for the fiscal year beginning the following April, it is officially called the Estimates, and unofficially the Blue Book. General direction and priority setting in the budget are prepared by the central agencies (eg. the finance and treasury departments and the Privy Council Office) who then negotiate adjustments, reconcile budget submissions of individual departments and prepare the total expenditure budget for submission to Parliament by the president of the Treasury Board.


Before 1971


	 Prior to 1971 Parliament was asked to approve everything from salaries to supplies, to old-age pensions to travel expenses for public servants. The most important determinant of expenditures on most items was the levels of spending on those items in the previous year. The prevailing view among those who participated in or studied the process was that the expenditure budget did not allow Parliament to exercise meaningful control or allow the Cabinet to plan effectively.


	 In many cases members of Parliament could not see any links between the planned spending of a particular department and the services the department provided. In addition, information was provided only for the fiscal year under consideration, so MPs were unable to gauge the potential spending implications of a budget item for subsequent years.


	 The same factors made it difficult for the government and its officials to relate its policy and program planning to its expenditures. It had no satisfactory way of determining the impact on spending of new programs under consideration. The reverse was also true; problems were made worse by the interdependencies among departments, because the spending of one department could reinforce, duplicate or cancel that of another.


Reform -1970s 


	 Significant reform was attempted in the early 1970s by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's government, which adopted a ""scientific"" or ""rational"" budgeting and decision-making process in the form of a Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS). As its name implies, PPBS was intended to integrate the policy-planning and budgetary processes. Rather than focusing on inputs or objects of expenditure, PPBS focused on outputs – the ultimate effects of government activities on Canadians.


	 Departmental activities were classified into programs and subprograms. A program was defined in relation to a particular aspect of social welfare –- eg, health, justice, safety or national security, and all activities with an impact on that area were to be part of that program. In practice, the classification of activities into programs was never clear-cut.


	 Theoretically, under the PPBS system, the Cabinet and the relevant central agencies (principally the Privy Council Office) were to plan and decide priorities as programs. Departments were to submit budget requests and conduct analyses showing how their activities contributed to the objectives of the various programs. Unsatisfactory activities could be altered or eliminated and relationships among departments' activities would be taken into account explicitly.


	 In operation, PPBS never fulfilled its promise, largely because the analysis, integral to the system, required massive quantities of data, including not only financial statistics, which were usually obtainable, but less readily available information on program operations and effects. In many cases the basic social science and other knowledge necessary to evaluate the impact of programs does not exist. For example, it is very difficult to gauge how spending for drug testing, a public medical-care system, the promotion of better nutrition, or health-related education actually affect the population's health, even if a level of health could be measured.


	 PPBS ignored the political realities of the budgetary process. A budget represents a compromise among competing interests and objectives both inside and outside government. Whether more money is spent on national defence or on social programs is fundamentally a question of social values and requires a political decision. Once these decisions are made, it is extremely costly and disruptive to fight all the bureaucratic and political battles anew each year. That is why, traditionally, budgetary processes have concentrated attention on the margins; except in exceptional circumstances, the bulk of government spending has remained basically undisturbed. Discussion centres on the allocation of new or incremental spending.


	 PPBS, if it had worked as planned, would have involved negotiating the entire budget every year. PPBS did, however, result in some modest improvements in the budgetary process. Analysis of the impacts of programs and activities is now commonplace. The format of the Blue Book presented to Parliament, while far from perfect, is more useful to MPs and fosters more informed debate.


	 In more recent decades there has been a series of reforms of the expenditure budget process aimed at integrating evaluation of programs, political priority setting and financing. From 1979 to 1989 a system known as PEMS (Policy and Expenditure Management System) was in place. Government programs were grouped into sectoral areas (eg, economic development, social policy) and each area was assigned an expenditure limit or envelope.


	 It was then left largely to committees of ministers with responsibilities in each area to determine how the total envelope was to be allocated to departments and programs within that area. The intent was to permit (and force) ministers in a common policy area to set priorities jointly, and to determine how expanded or new programs should be financed by reducing or eliminating others within their sector.


Reform-1990s to present 


	 Since PEMS, changes in the budget process (and corresponding changes in the Cabinet structure) have been made to support government efforts to restrain spending and reduce the budget deficit. Generally, these changes have been designed to concentrate the power to authorize spending in the hands of key central agency ministers, most prominently the minister of finance. Expenditure control appears to be exercised most effectively when authority to spend is restricted in this fashion. In the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, centralized structure was known simply as the Expenditure Management System (EMS).


	 Under the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper the budgetary process has, if anything, become even more centralized. Consistent with the overall concentration of decision-making in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) under Harper, virtually all budgetary directives come from the Department of Finance which closely co-ordinates with the PMO.


	 The centralization of decision-making authority has allowed changes to the budget structure under Harper. Generally these have been to reduce government spending relative to the size of the economy and to lower tax rates accordingly. The major exception to this trend was the period beginning in late 2008 when the government reluctantly engaged in major infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy, which along with most other western industrial countries had entered a serious recession and financial crisis.


	 This episode is interesting from a budgetary perspective because it shows the pressures that governments face from their electorates (and, in this case, from their international trading partners as well) to respond to short-term crises – especially high unemployment – even though the government’s primary focus might be on changing the long-term structural fundamentals of spending and taxation.


	 Students of government and the media appropriately focus much attention on budgetary processes. Often this attention is mainly on the “nuts and bolts” of changes in processes. What is often overlooked is what underlies these changes. They do not simply appear “out of thin air’; nor are they exercises to replace poor systems with better ones. Budgetary processes are put in place and are changed to better serve the goals and priorities of the government of the day. Thus, for example, when a government is determined to reduce its spending or tightly control its rate of increase, it may establish a highly centralized system that limits the discretionary room of ministers to make expenditure commitments. A government designs the budgetary process to facilitate the pursuit of the goals it sets and to achieve the results it desires.

Canada and the G7 (Group of Seven);https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/g7-group-of-seven;"The G7, or Group of Seven, is an international group comprising the governments of the world’s largest economies: Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States
	and Canada. It was founded as the G6 in 1975 and became the G7 with the addition of Canada in 1976. The Group is an informal bloc; it has no treaty or constitution and no permanent offices, staff or secretariat. The leaders of the member states meet
	at annual summits to discuss issues of mutual concern and to coordinate actions to address them. The meeting location and the organization’s presidency rotates among the members. The European Union is also a non-enumerated member, though it never assumes
	the rotating presidency.";"During the Cold War, the finance ministers of France, West Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States met in Washington in March 1973 at the suggestion of American
	treasury secretary George Shultz. The meeting allowed them to better understand shared problems and to coordinate their responses.
After the Washington meeting, French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and German chancellor Helmut Schmidt called for national leaders to meet on a regular basis. France hosted the first G6 meeting, which included Japan and Italy, at the Château de
	Rambouillet, France, on 15–17 November 1975. At the top of the agenda were the dramatic rise in world oil prices and the resulting global recession that had both been triggered by the actions of the Organization of Oil Producing Countries (OPEC) beginning
	in late 1973. It was also agreed at Rambouillet that the Group would meet annually. (See also Oil and Gas Policy in Canada, 1947–80.) The informal
	organization was dubbed the Group of Six or G6.
The 15-point Declaration of Rambouillet stated that the six countries had come together because of their “shared beliefs and shared responsibilities.” They promised to “intensify our cooperation on all these problems in the framework of existing institutions
	as well as in all the relevant international organizations.” The declaration stated the group’s support of multilateralism, free trade, and more cooperation among liberal democracies
	and with socialist countries.




When Canada was invited to join in 1976, the G6 became the G7. A year later, the European Community (now called the European Union) was invited to attend G7 summits. It joined as a non-enumerated member and never assumes the rotating presidency.
The Soviet Union (now Russia) began attending in 1989. Despite having a small economy compared to other members, Russia was invited to join the Group in 1997. This was done to help
	the country in its transition from communism to capitalism and to help it peacefully integrate in international affairs.
However, in 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, which was part of Ukraine. The other G8 members condemned the action and removed Russia from the group. The G8 was again the G7. At the 2018 and 2019 G7 summits, US president Donald Trump advocated
	for Russia’s return to the group. The other leaders refused, believing it would legitimize Russia’s aggressive actions.

The G7 is an informal bloc. It has no treaty or constitution and no permanent offices, staff or secretariat. The leaders of the member states meet at annual summits to discuss issues
	of mutual concern and to coordinate actions to address them. The meeting location rotates among the members. The host country’s head of government acts as president. The president
	sets the agenda, after consultation with other members, and chairs the meeting. Every summit concludes with the release of a non-binding communiqué. It summarizes the issues discussed and the decisions made.
Between summits, G7 cabinet ministers consult on matters of mutual interest to coordinate research, implement communiqué goals, and develop ideas for future meetings. Cabinet ministers
	comprise G7 Ministerial Groups, which focus on issues such as the environment, trade, health	and the digital economy.
Additional work is done between summits by G7 engagement groups. These are non-governmental organizations and civil society groups in all member countries who coordinate with each other. They develop policy ideas that they then try to have included in
	the next summit. G7 engagement groups have addressed issues related to women, youth, labour,
	science, climate change, trade	and business.
Canada has hosted six G7 summits: Ottawa-Montebello, Ontario-Quebec	(1981); Toronto, Ontario (1988); Halifax, Nova Scotia	(1995); Kananaskis, Alberta (2002); Muskoka,
	Ontario (2010); and Charlevoix, Quebec (2018). Through its G7 membership, Canada has advanced international discussion of issues that reflect its priorities and values. For example, at the 2018 G7 Charlevoix summit, Canadian efforts were instrumental
	in seeing $3.8 billion devoted to promoting education for women and girls in areas of crisis.

G7 efforts have reflected the growing international interdependence brought about by globalization. However, globalization has also inspired resistance and protests on the grounds
	that it has lowered environmental, labour and living standards. In 1998, approximately 70,000 protesters formed a human chain around the site of the G7 summit in Birmingham,
	England. In July 2001, 200,000 protesters gathered at the G7 meeting in Genoa, Italy. Confrontations between police and protesters led to many injuries and arrests. One protester was shot and killed.
The anti-globalization protests at G7 meetings mirrored the even more violent protests at other multilateral meetings: most notably the 1999 World Trade Organization	(WTO) meeting in Seattle, the 2001 Summit of the Americas meeting in Quebec City, and the 2010 Group of 20 summit in Toronto.
	In response, G7 meetings began to be held with increased security in more remote areas away from city centres.




Critics of the G7 note that when the bloc was formed in the mid-1970s, it represented 70 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). As a result, members
	could speak and act with genuine authority on matters of international economics. However, that authority came under scrutiny as the development of non-G7 economies, especially
	that of China, shrunk the G7’s share of the global GDP to 50 per cent. To address that change, a larger group, called the G20 or Group of 20, was formed in 1999. It includes G7 members as well as many countries with developing and influential economies.
	The G20 also meets annually to discuss issues of international concern.
Critics have also observed that the G7 often fails to comply with the stated goals of its annual communiqués. In response, the G7 formed a Research Group in 1996. It publishes an annual evaluation of compliance. Since 2010, each member nation has also
	been expected to produce its own annual report outlining its compliance with G7 goals and pledges.

	Canada Corn Act, passed in 1843 by the British Parliament and applying to all grains, allowed Canadian wheat to enter the British market at a nominal duty, and flour manufactured in Canada at a proportionate rate. The latter clause was a victory for those seeking to make the St Lawrence a major conduit for American wheat. By removing barriers to Canadian wheat exports imposed by periods of low prices in Britain, the Act encouraged expansion of wheat acreage and flour-milling capacity in Upper Canada. But the Act was short-lived, since Britain was moving towards free trade and repealed the CORN LAWS in 1846.

Canada Land Inventory;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-land-inventory;Canada Land Inventory is a comprehensive federal-provincial survey of LAND capability and use for regional resource and land-use planning established under the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Development Act in 1961.;"
	Canada Land Inventory is a comprehensive federal-provincial survey of LAND capability and use for regional resource and land-use planning established under the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Development Act in 1961.


	In the late 1950s and early 1960s, problems of land-use conflict, competition for land and land misuse were becoming more common. These problems were addressed in a series of conferences, and a major recommendation emerged to classify and map land capabilities across southern Canada.


	CLI was established under the Agricultural Rehabilitation (Rural, 1966) and Development Act, 1961 (ARDA) when it became evident, as programs were being formulated, a rational approach to land-use adjustment and planning could not be undertaken without knowledge of the land's capability to support agriculture and other feasible alternative uses. To provide this knowledge, the CLI project was launched in 1963; it was essentially completed in 1975-76.


	CLI provided the first uniform, nationwide measure of Canada's land-based renewable resource wealth. The inventory, covering roughly 2.6 million km2 (25% of Canada), included assessments of land capability for agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife (waterfowl, ungulates and sportfish).


	An inventory of present land-use and pilot land-use planning projects in all 10 provinces were essential parts of the program. In each classification category, units of land were mapped and grouped into one of 7 classes (with subclasses): class 1 the highest capability, class 7 the lowest. In general, classes 1-3 are considered prime or highly productive lands.


	Census data, aerial photographs, assessment rolls and other sources were used to map present land-use, dated to about 1967.


	At the national scale, CLI data provides the basis for an assessment of the nature of land-use and land-use changes in Canada, particularly in terms of the encroachment of urban sprawl onto agricultural and other prime resource lands. Through CLI it has been established that only 10% of Canada's land, in practical terms, is suitable for agriculture. From this 10%, the nation obtains a variety of produce, including large quantities for export. Owing to the dependence of Canada on the produce from the land, it is essential to understand the limits of the land resource, the location of prime lands and the forces that may effect the capability of the location of prime lands.


	The CLI program provides a common reference for professional and lay bodies concerned with land-use planning and fueled policy development in every province. Planners have used it to identify potential parks and WILDLIFE PRESERVES and to assess areas of recreation and tourism potential.


	It has enabled some provinces to enact legislation to protect agricultural land and to identify submarginal farmland. Perhaps the single most dramatic and significant example of the application of CLI data is BC's designation of Agricultural Land Reserves established by the BC Land Commission in the 1970s.


	Output from the program was large and included 20 000 field maps at 1:50 000; 1200 published maps at scales of 1:250 000 and 1:1 000 000; and numerous reports and analyses. Over one million copies of these maps were printed. Only a few sample maps of land-use generalized to 1:250 000 were ever published. The program ended in the early 1990s due to budgetary constraints but various provinces have utilized CLI and augmented it with provincial data. Reports describing the classifications and summarizing the results are available only through libraries.


	CLI has helped Canadians make better decisions about the use of their lands and resources. It has, equally importantly, helped to influence perceptions and understanding of Canada. As our focus is now towards the sustainable development of resources, the data, expertise and sensitivity which are the legacies of the CLI experience will be needed more than ever.

Canada Pension Plan;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-pension-plan;The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is an earnings-related public pension plan. The CPP makes a monthly payment to Canadians and their families to partially replace their income after retirement, disability or death. Working Canadians make regular contributions to the CPP in order to be eligible. The CPP covers all Canadian workers except those in Quebec who are covered by the parallel Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) manages CPP assets, making it one of the largest pension fund managers in the world. As of 31 March 2021, CPPIB ended its 2021 fiscal year with net assets of 497.2 billion.;"The CPP was created through federal-provincial negotiations in 1965, as
	a response to growing poverty among retired Canadians. Its target benefit at the time was to cover 25 per cent of a worker’s average lifetime earnings, up to a stated
	ceiling on earnings covered.
The CPP was originally financed entirely by payroll  contributions from employers, employees and the self-employed. Benefits depended on current contributions. The CPP now earns investment income, along with payroll contributions, which are split
	equally between employers and employees, with the self-employed paying the full rate.
For 2019, the average monthly CPP pension received by a retiring 65-year-old person  was $679.16 – versus a  maximum of $1,154.58. Plan participants can opt to start receiving their pension anytime
	between the ages of 60 and 70, with the annual pension amount adjusted down or up on an actuarially-fair basis. The Plan also features an array of ancillary benefits for survivors, for disability and for death.
The cost of the Plan at the end of 2019 was 9.9 per cent of pay (split 50-50 between the worker and the employer) on annual earnings between $3,500 and the maximum eligible earnings cap of $57,400.
Since inception, the CPP has gone through two major reforms:
In 1997, contribution rates were doubled to 9.9 per cent of pay. The target of covering 25 per cent of a worker's average lifetime earnings was maintained.
As Canada's population aged, and its workforce declined relative to the number of retirees, there was concern that current contributions would not be enough to finance retiree benefits. If changes weren't made, the CPP would eventually run out of money.
As a result, rates were doubled to create a reserve fund, designed to increase confidence in the sustainability of the Plan, and to forestall further contribution rate increases.
At the same time the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board was established to invest and manage the reserve fund.
In 2016, CPP benefits were enhanced to eventually cover 33 per cent of average lifetime earnings, up from the original 25 per cent. At the same time, the ceiling on earnings covered was raised by 14 per cent. These reforms were designed to be
	phased in slowly between 2019 and 2025. The changes will eventually raise the maximum annual CPP pension to $20,600.
The 2016 reforms were triggered by several events, including the election of a new Liberal government in Ottawa	that favoured enhancing CPP benefits, in large part to make up for the decline in corporate pension plans among Canadian workers. (In 1977, more than 46 per cent of Canadian workers had registered pension plans through their jobs. By 2011, the number
	had fallen to fewer than 39 per cent, according to Statistics Canada.) An expanded CPP was seen as one way to alleviate the disappearance of corporate pensions.
Governments had been talking about making changes to CPP benefits for years. A new federal-provincial agreement was also finally made possible thanks to pressure from the Ontario	government, which had been making alternate plans to create its own Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP) initiative. As a result of the 2016 CPP deal, the ORPP was shelved.
The 2016 reforms were also made possible by political agreement on the need for a long, 2019-2025 phase-in period for the CPP contribution increases – to ensure that both employers and employees can plan for these phased increases without material cash-flow
	disruptions.

The estimated cost, or contribution increase, required by the 2016 changes is an additional 2 per cent to be paid on earnings up to the 2016 cap of $54,900, as well as 8 per cent on earnings between $54,900 and $62,500 (in 2016 dollars). All such contribution
	rate increases are to be shared 50-50 between employers and employees.
The enhancements in CPP benefits and contributions will increase cash-flows into the CPP for decades to come. This means the year when investment income from CPP assets will be needed to help pay CPP benefits now lies well beyond the year of 2023 indicated
	in the 26th CPP Actuarial Report.
The 2016 CPP reforms will benefit younger Canadians the most. They will have the most time to work and contribute under the Plan, and to receive the full benefits of its enhancements once those are completely phased in by 2025.
The 2016 enhancements are less meaningful for Canadians near the end of their working lives. The CPP reforms also do little for Canadians who collect few or no CPP benefits, because they worked most of their lives as homemakers, for example. This is particularly
	true for many women seniors.
Originally, CPP surpluses were lent to the provinces, invested in non-marketable securities of provincial governments.
The 1997 decision to quickly double the CPP contribution rate in order to build up CPP asset reserves led to the creation of an organization to manage the reserves: the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). By the end of 2016, the CPPIB had become
	one of the largest pension fund managers in the world, managing some $300-billion of CPP reserves, an amount that is projected to continue to grow in the decades ahead. More than half of those reserves are the result of investment returns generated by
	the CPPIB.
The CPPIB has developed a global reputation for its asset management skills, with over 80 per cent of its assets invested outside Canada, and 50 invested in private markets investments in debt, equity, real estate, and infrastructure.
It has offices in Toronto, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Sao Paulo, employing some 1,300 people."

	 Canada Savings Bonds differ from other government bonds in that they can be cashed at any bank for the face value plus accrued interest. They cannot be sold by the original buyer but must be held until cashed or until they mature (usually in 7 years) from the time they were bought. The interest rate has been as high as 19.5% and as low as 2.75%, the rate on the first issue in 1946. Canada Savings Bonds, which can be bought on payroll deduction plans and which range in denomination from $100 to $10 000, grew out of the successful raising of money for the war effort in WWII by Victory Bonds and the sale of War Savings Certificates and stamps, not to traditional investors, but to ordinary citizens and even to school children. From the start there has been a limit on the amount of any one issue that any Canadian - they are not sold outside the country - can buy. This limit has been as low as $15 000 and as high as $75 000 (1986). Canada Savings Bonds are a major source of federal government finance; in late 1992 the federal government had borrowed about $35 billion from the public in this form, out of a total debt of $290 billion.

Canada’s Temporary Foreign Worker Programs;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadas-temporary-foreign-worker-programs;Temporary foreign worker programs are regulated by the federal government and allow employers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis to fill gaps in their workforces. Each province and territory also has its own set of policies that affect the administration of the programs. Canada depends on thousands of migrant workers every year to bolster its economy and to support its agricultural, homecare, and other lower-wage sectors. In 2014, there were 567,077 migrant workers employed in Canada, with migrant farm workers making up 12 per cent of Canada’s agricultural workforce. A growing labour shortage is projected to increase, with a study by the Conference Board of Canada projecting 113,800 unfilled jobs by 2025.;"
	Due to the isolation of the workers and the temporary nature of many of these programs, there are documented cases of abuse and rights infringements, including inadequate housing, poor access to health care, inability to collectively bargain, family separation,
	illegal recruitment fees, and cases of violence and sexual abuse. To date, Canada has not signed and ratified the United Nations	International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the only international instrument specifically drafted to protect the rights of migrant workers.

	International, temporary labour migration is defined as the movement of people from one country to another for the purposes of employment for a brief period of time. There are two
	labour migration programs in Canada: the International Mobility Program (IMP) and the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP).

	by responding to labour shortages (see Labour Force). It allows employers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis to fill gaps in their workforces. The TFWP
	differs from the IMP in that employers must file a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to show that no Canadian or permanent resident worker is available to complete the job.




	There are currently four streams under which employers can apply to Canada’s TFWP: the high-wage stream, the low-wage stream, the primary agriculture stream (including Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program or SAWP), and the stream dedicated to supporting
	permanent residency. As of 2014, the Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is no longer a stand-alone stream, and LMIA applications are assessed in both the high-wage and low-wage streams.

	Canada’s temporary foreign worker programs can be thought of as unique bilateral agreements between nations, such as the SAWP, which was first introduced in 1966 in an agreement with Jamaica. Under the SAWP, migrant workers cannot seek employment outside
	their work contract and cannot apply for permanent resident status (see Citizenship).

	The LCP program is dominated by caregivers from the Philippines and was introduced in 1992 to address the lack of live-in caregivers in Canada. LCPs work in individual
	homes and, due to this isolation, are often unable to exercise their rights under provincial minimum employment standards (see Employment Law). This regime has resulted
	in great difficulty with measuring overtime hours in a largely deregulated and invisible environment, and has given rise to a host of abuse allegations. However, unlike the SAWPs, LCPs can eventually apply for permanent resident status in Canada, after
	completing 24 months of paid employment within a period of four years.

	A pilot program (originally known as Low-Skill Pilot) was introduced in 2002 in order to bring in more low-skilled workers to fill clerical, sales, service and transportation	related jobs. These workers, like the SAWPs, generally cannot apply for permanent resident status in Canada and, while a spouse may accompany the worker, they cannot obtain their own work permit in Canada, in contrast to spouses who accompany high-skilled
	immigrants (see Immigration in Canada).

	Migration in Canada is governed federally by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, implemented in 2002 (see Refugees).
	The Act recognizes five types of migrant workers under its economic migration class: (1) workers selected for immigration and granted permanent residence; (2) visitors authorized to work temporarily without a work permit; (3) foreign workers authorized
	to work temporarily in Canada upon obtaining a work permit from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC); (4) foreign workers authorized to work temporarily in Canada upon obtaining both an authorization from Employment and Social Development
	Canada and a work permit from IRCC; and, (5) undocumented migrant workers. The Act provides these categories, as well as limited guidance on certain procedural issues. It also explicitly vests the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship with
	the authority to issue special instructions to officers at his or her discretion. IRCC regularly provides updated administrative guidelines, that set out specific regulations to be followed by IRCC officers.

	The day-to-day administration of temporary foreign worker programs falls to the provinces, where workers are protected under provincial legislation for issues of health
	and safety, occupational and employment standards, and wage distribution. There is variation between the provinces in terms of enforcement, quotas, and protections for workers.

	There are also international legal instruments that govern the rights protection for temporary foreign workers. The United Nations International Convention on the Protection
	of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (CMW) is the only UN treaty that grants specific rights to migrant workers. Many of the rights in the CMW are derived from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
	and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), both of which Canada has ratified. Some of the rights stipulated in the CMW are entirely new rights pertaining specially to migrant workers and their families. While rights
	stipulated in core human rights treaties are meant to apply to all peoples regardless of their nationality, their application to migrant workers is not often specified. As such, the CMW has been characterized as a more precise interpretation of human
	rights in the case of migrant workers. However, the CMW is the least ratified treaty among all the major human rights treaties. As of December 2017, only 51 countries had ratified
	the CMW, just over one quarter of the ratifications of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and less than one third of the ratifications of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

	Migrant workers in Canada are protected under federal instruments such as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and under various provincial laws that
	ensure workplace and occupational health and safety, employment standards and human rights. However, there are gaps in the enforcement of these protections, and human rights abuses have been documented in all TFW programs: racism,
	discrimination, and dubious contracts that prevent workers from forming outside relationships and that police their behaviour (such as mandating the use of
	deodorant). Migrant workers can also experience abuse at the hands of third-party recruiters, who charge thousands of dollars for various applications or assistance throughout the process, a practice that is illegal in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nova
	Scotia. Protracted family separation also negatively affects the well-being of many workers in Canada, some of whom have worked in Canada for decades without the ability to attain permanent resident status.

	A 2017 investigation by the Toronto Star revealed that there continue to be documented cases of inadequate housing,
	lack of access to heath care, lack of overtime and cases of violence and sexual abuse.

	Migrant workers have also been pushing for the right to unionize, with temporary farm workers leading the charge (see Labour Law). However, in Frazer v. Ontario (Attorney General),
	which became known as the “Mushroom Workers case,” the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that section 2(d) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not require labour
	statutes to incorporate a particular model of collective bargaining for temporary farm workers, effectively denying migrant workers statutory labour rights protection.

	Repatriation of workers back to their countries when they have been hurt on the job has also been documented. Migrant workers experiencing illness or injuries preventing them from working are often fired and repatriated to their home country, without
	any ability to appeal the repatriation. Between 2001 and 2011, 787 medical repatriations occurred among the 170,315 migrant farm workers in Ontario. Of the 787 medical repatriations, 41.3 per cent were due to medical or surgical reasons and 25.5 per
	cent were due to external injuries. Other types of temporary foreign workers, such as LCPs, also face the risk of repatriation.

	While migrant workers must pay federal and provincial taxes, their access to social programs is severely restricted. Similarly to the barriers to their access to health services,
	migrant workers have difficulties accessing social services because of their long work hours, lack of transportation, social isolation, lack of services in rural
	areas, language and cultural differences, awareness of available support and services and other conditions of their employment. In some cases, employers keep workers from leaving the premises after work. Migrant workers also make contributions to the
	Canada Pension Plan (CPP), which on paper will give them a pension upon retirement at age 65. However, most migrant workers will not claim their pension due to a lack
	of understanding of the CPP and how to claim their pension. If they do manage to claim their pension, the amount they can claim is extremely low as it is difficult to accrue sufficient hours.

	Canada has not signed and ratified the CMW. While the federal government has not stated why it is reluctant to ratify the Convention, a 2006 UNESCO-sponsored study investigated
	some of the reasons behind Canada’s resistance to ratify the CMW. For example, the parliamentarians and federal government employees profiled in the study thought of the additional
	rights as superfluous, given those already guaranteed by the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, or the Convention Against Torture. Also, the CMW was largely thought to arise out of
	the need to regulate guest workers who were brought in to deal with labour shortages in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. The immigration philosophy behind Canada’s TFWP was considered
	different from this model. Instead of following overarching international laws, Canada implemented contractual bilateral agreements between specific states.

	The CMW was also seen as largely redundant, since basic rights are already guaranteed to everyone under the ICESCR and ICCPR. Migrant workers were not seen as an especially vulnerable group needing specific protections, as they can rely on the ISESCR,
	ICCPR, as well as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and provincial workplace safety legislation. Also, ratifying the CMW would call for a drastic
	restructuring of Canada’s low-skill temporary foreign worker programs. In contrast to the direct opposition to the CMW by federal government employees, the CMW was largely unknown among parliamentarians profiled in the study.

	However, human rights abuses of migrant workers have received significant media attention. As a result, on 21 March 2016, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Human Resources,
	Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities adopted a motion to study the TFWP with a focus on the current program and how to improve it.

	The New Democratic Party (NDP) criticized the committee for not providing a
	recommendation to ensure that all migrant workers have a pathway to permanent residency. The NDP also called on the government to provide additional resources for migrant worker organizations to assist migrant workers in protecting their rights, allow
	for unionization among migrant workers, to ensure adequate health and safety rules are in place, to require that health care be provided in Canada when workplace injuries occur, and to allow access to employment insurance	benefits.

	In December 2016, the government responded briefly to the committee, stating that they were working to introduce stronger recruitment requirements for low-wage employers so that Canadian workers who were traditionally under-represented in the labour market
	could have better access to available job opportunities. As well, the government planned to eliminate the four-year cumulative duration rule, to extend the exemption on the cap for seasonal industries for 2017, and to commit to developing pathways
	to permanent residence for migrant workers. On 13 December 2016, the four-year cumulative duration rule (“four-in, four-out” rule), which banned migrant workers from working in Canada for four years after they had spent four years working here, was rendered
	no longer effective by the federal government.

	Canada relies heavily on its temporary foreign worker programs and employs thousands of migrant workers every year. While rights protection mechanisms exist both on the provincial as well as federal level, and Canada has committed to improving its temporary
	foreign worker programs, abuses of migrant workers continue to be documented. Many temporary foreign workers live a precarious existence, with no pathway towards permanent residence."
Canada-US Auto Pact;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canada-us-automotive-products-agreement;The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965, better known as the Canada-US Auto Pact, led to the integration of the Canadian and US auto industries in a shared North American market. While it brought great benefits to Canada, it was eventually found to be contrary to international trade rules and was cancelled in 2001. By then it had accomplished its biggest goal — an integrated North American industry with a much stronger Canadian presence.;"
	            The Auto Pact was a compromise agreement between Canada and the United States, triggered by Canadian efforts to deal with chronic trade and current account deficits in the early 1960s. Building a more competitive automotive industry was seen as a crucial part of the solution to Canada’s troubled economy. Canada was running a persistent automotive trade deficit with the United States in finished vehicles and in auto parts at the time, and had little prospect of attracting investment and building a stronger industry to create jobs and reduce the trade deficit without government intervention.

	            In 1964, Canada had a roughly $600-million auto trade deficit with the United States. Canada was producing about 7 per cent of Canada/US auto output, but accounted for less than 1 per cent of US sales around this time.

	            The fundamental problem was that Canada’s auto industry was highly inefficient. The subsidiaries of US companies, operating in Canada behind a high tariff wall, assembled a wide range of different models in Canada at production levels insufficient to achieve the economies of scale needed for commercial success. They had been set up as branch plants not only for the Canadian market, but to take advantage of earlier trade preferences with the British Commonwealth, which had by then lost much of their value. There was no incentive to invest in Canada. Productivity was about 60–65 per cent of US levels, and industry wages were about 70 per cent of US levels. Meanwhile, Canadian consumers paid much higher prices for automobiles and had less choice than their American neighbours.

	            Fearful of a declining auto industry and worried about the trade deficit, the government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker had in 1960 appointed Vincent Bladen, a University of Toronto economist, to study the industry. In his report, Bladen rejected free trade as a solution because, he argued, Canadian industry was unprepared and would be much diminished. He also rejected higher tariffs as counterproductive. Instead, Bladen proposed measures to increase Canadian content in auto products by allowing companies to import vehicles and parts duty-free, provided they met Canadian content requirements.



As a result, in 1962 Canada re-imposed a 25 per cent tariff on imported automatic transmissions while at the same time introducing a duty-remission scheme that would allow auto companies to offset tariffs on imported transmissions and engine blocks, by increasing the export of Canadian-made auto parts — an incentive designed to boost Canadian production. In 1963, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson strengthened the arrangement, extending the duty-remission scheme to vehicles and all original parts. The scheme proved effective. The goals were to boost Canadian output and employment, reduce the trade deficit and create opportunity for Canadians to gain access to markets, as well as encourage specialization, longer production runs and lower costs.

	            But Canadian policy was challenged by a US auto parts company that had lost business under the scheme. With support from other US auto parts companies, it quickly sought a ruling by the US treasury department on whether this was a subsidy under US law. The fear, in both countries, was that the Canadian scheme would be found to be an illegal subsidy, thus risking a trade conflict that neither country, nor the industry, wanted. The United States delayed investigating and publishing a finding on the complaint, since Canada was expected to lose the case. A finding was never published.

	            After intensive diplomatic negotiations through the summer and fall of 1964, the two countries reached a compromise agreement. The resulting Auto Pact was a managed trade agreement that limited which companies could benefit, and imposed ongoing conditions or safeguards to ensure growth of the industry in Canada. The Americans had sought a free trade agreement, but Canada wanted an agreement with safeguards. A pure free trade agreement, Canada argued, would lead to a much diminished auto industry in Canada since all the key investment and production decisions would be made in the United States.

	            The agreement was signed at the LBJ Ranch in Johnson City, Texas, on 16 January 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk for the United States, and Prime Minister Lester Pearson and External Affairs Minister Paul Martin Sr. for Canada.

It was a short document that sought “the creation of a broader market for automotive products within which the full benefits of specialization and large-scale production can be achieved.” The overarching goal, it said, was “the development of conditions in which market forces may operate efficiently to attain the most economic pattern of investment, production and trade.”

	            Products had to have 50 per cent Canada/US content to qualify. The agreement applied to cars, trucks, buses and original automotive parts, but excluded aftermarket auto parts, batteries, tires and used cars.

	            The agreement also contained two annexes, both written by Canada. These limited participation in the Auto Pact to auto assemblers already producing in Canada in the period August 1963 through July 1964 — notably including General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, American Motors (acquired by Chrysler in 1987), Studebaker (ceased production in 1966) and Volvo (a small operation in Halifax that closed in 1998). They also set a minimum level of Canadian value added that assemblers had to achieve. And they effectively required that for every vehicle sold in Canada, a vehicle must be produced in Canada.

	            Alongside the agreement, auto manufacturers also submitted letters of agreement pledging $260 million in new investment for increased Canadian value added.

	            There was opposition in both countries, though for far different reasons — in Canada because it was not seen as doing enough to create a Canadian auto industry, and in the United States because it strayed from free market principles.

	            In 1965, the year the Auto Pact came into effect, Canada had a $785-million automotive trade deficit with the United States. The impact of the agreement was swift — Canada’s share of North American auto production rose from 7.1 per cent in 1965 to 11.2 per cent by 1971, and by 1970 Canada had achieved a modest trade surplus.

	            But the Canadian surpluses became a major irritant in the United States. The American view was that the safeguards Canada maintained on the production/sales ratio and value-added minimums were meant to be temporary, while Canada insisted they were permanent. The US took the view that, as the agreement said, the goal was a free market system, while Canada pointed to another clause that said the goal of the agreement was to enable both countries to participate “on a fair and equitable basis” in an expanding North American market.

	            In 1970, the US Senate Finance Committee asked the president to achieve “complete freedom of trade” in the industry by 1973. In 1971, six years after the Auto Pact came into effect, the US took drastic action to deal with its own balance of payments crisis, and the administration of President Richard Nixon came within a hair’s breadth of cancelling the agreement. It was only saved by swift action on the part of a US official who caught sight of a draft document cancelling the Auto Pact.

	            The US continued to chafe at Canadian safeguards in the agreement. In July 1975, the Senate Finance Committee asked the US International Trade Commission (ITC) to determine whether or not Canada had “fully complied with the letter and spirit of the Agreement by phasing out so-called ‘transitional provisions.’” The ITC concluded Canada had not.

	            Despite these disagreements, automotive trade between the two countries skyrocketed. In 1966, Canadian vehicle and parts exports to the US totalled $886 million. In 1977, exports were $9.9 billion. Similarly, Canadian imports from the US grew from $1.5 billion in 1966 to $10.9 billion in 1977. The US trade surplus, which over the life of Auto Pact moved back and forth from surplus to deficit, grew from $601 million in 1966 to $1.1 billion in 1977 — although Canada had surpluses in some of the intervening years.



Through the life of the Auto Pact, Canada tended to have surpluses in vehicles and deficits in parts. In 1977, for example, Canada had a surplus of $2 billion in vehicles, a deficit of $3 billion in parts. In 1977, Canadian value added in vehicles and parts was five times greater than in 1964. By 1975, the industry directly supported more than 100,000 Canadian middle-class jobs. The auto sector had become Canada’s most important export industry.

	            Overall, the Auto Pact achieved its goal of an integrated Canada-US production network. In 1965, Canada exported just 48,000 vehicles to the United States, representing just 6 per cent of Canadian production while the US exported just 64,000 vehicles to Canada, or just 0.6 per cent of US production of North American type vehicles. A decade later, in 1975, Canada exported 849,000 vehicles to the US, representing 59 per cent of Canadian production while the US exported 698,000 vehicles to Canada, representing 8 per cent of US production.

	            As the 1970s progressed, the Japanese auto industry moved into North America. In 1965, Japanese companies had just 0.3 per cent of the Canadian market. By 1975, this had risen to 8.5 per cent and by 1985 to 16.4 per cent. Toyota and Isuzu began selling cars in Canada in 1965, followed by Honda in 1970. In 1986, Honda opened its first manufacturing plant in Canada, followed by Toyota in 1988.

	            Since Japanese companies could not join the Auto Pact, Canada attracted Japanese companies by offering duty-remission incentives, which tied the ability to import vehicles duty-free to exports to the United States and elsewhere from Canadian-based assembly plants. The United States was concerned that Japanese automakers would build plants in Canada to serve the US market. So in Canada-US free trade negotiations in the 1980s, the US had two objectives — the adoption of automotive free trade with the elimination of Auto Pact conditions, and the elimination of Canada’s duty-remission incentives.

	            While the 1989 Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) still retained the Auto Pact’s Canadian safeguards, Canada agreed to phase out its duty-remissions scheme. In addition, the two countries agreed to phase out tariffs on cross-border trade in new vehicles and parts by non-Auto Pact producers over 10 years, starting in 1989. This meant that vehicles of Asian and European companies made in North America had the same free trade privileges as the original participants in the Auto Pact, provided they met the 50 per cent North American content requirement set out in the FTA (later raised to 62.5 per cent).

	            With the FTA and later the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Auto Pact became less important in determining industry investment, though it was seen as an important irritant by Asian and European automakers because of the preference it gave to the US industry.



In 1994, Canada implemented the global rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Uruguay Round, which, as it happened, provided the basis for ending the Auto Pact. Both Japan and the European Union contended that key features of the Auto Pact were inconsistent with global trade rules, and they won this argument before the WTO’s dispute settlement panels. On 19 February 2001, Canada officially ended the Auto Pact.

	            The cancellation was barely noticed. By that time, Canada’s auto industry was operating far above the production/sales ratio and the minimum value-added requirements of the Auto Pact. It had been a creature of its times, and those times had changed once Asian and European automotive companies had become major investors in North America.

	            Nonetheless, the Auto Pact had been important for several reasons. It had helped launch a much more competitive auto industry in Canada, which had a major impact on middle-class job creation, productivity and trade performance; it had triggered and sustained an economic boom across southern Ontario; it had spawned several Canadian-headquartered global auto parts companies such as Magna International and Linamar; it had integrated the industry on both sides of the border, narrowing the price gap between cars in Canada and the United States and leading to greater choice for consumers; and it had demonstrated the benefits  of integration — leading, in the early 1980s, to a search for other sectors where similar arrangements could be made. None fitted the unique nature of the auto industry. However, without a successful Auto Pact, it is unlikely that Canada and the United States would have decided to pursue a much broader free trade agreement.

	Created in 2000, the privately funded Canadian Democracy and Corporate Accountability Commission (CDCAC) was co-chaired by Canadian publisher Avie Bennett and ex-NDP leader Ed Broadbent. Its purpose was to study how to encourage greater corporate social responsibility on the part of Canadian corporations.


	Derided by some in the business community, the CDCAC's activities nevertheless reflected changing attitudes on the part of the public and of shareholders concerning corporate responsibility with regard to employees, local communities and the country or countries in which they operate. It also reflected a growing interest in finding ways to balance profit-making with values that go beyond the ""bottom line.""


	In January 2002 the Commission released its findings and recommendations. The latter focused strongly on disclosure. For example, the Commissioners recommended that stock exchanges require companies wishing to be listed to state whether they took account of the environment, human rights and consumer protection in their decision-making; that whistle-blowing legislation provide protection for employees reporting corporate malfeasance; that governments provide help only to those companies that meet basic social responsibility standards; and, following the examples of Quebec and Manitoba, that federal and provincial governments prohibit corporate and union donations to political campaigns.

Canadian Free Trade Agreement;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-free-trade-agreement;The Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) is an inter-governmental trade agreement regulating trade within Canada. It took effect on 1 July 2017. The goal of the agreement was to reduce or eliminate regulations against the free movement of goods, services, and investments within Canada. The officials who framed the new deal said they wanted to ensure that Canadian firms got the same access to the Canadian market as firms from the country’s international trading partners.  CFTA also more closely matches the terms of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA), which began taking effect in 2017.;"
	  The British North America Act (now, Constitution Act, 1867) set the rules for internal trade in the newly created Dominion of Canada. Section 121 declares that “All articles of the Growth, Produce or Manufacture of any of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.” However, Section 122 declares that “The Customs and Excise Laws of each Province shall, subject to the Provisions of this Act, continue in force until altered by the Parliament of Canada.”


	  In 1994, Canada’s provincial and territorial leaders updated the rules with the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). The AIT took force 1 July 1995, with the aim of eliminating barriers to trade and improving investment and mobility within Canada. The agreement prevented provincial governments and territorial governments from erecting new trade barriers and required them to reduce existing rules affecting goods covered by the AIT. It also called for ongoing negotiations and adjustments to further liberalize trade in the country.


	  At the time, Canada had two international free-trade agreements — with Mexico and the United States (see North American Free Trade Agreement).





	  The federal government subsequently signed free-trade agreements with 13 countries (see International Trade). The AIT did not change and when Canada’s Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce examined it in 2016, it found that “unnecessary regulatory and legislative differences” created walls stopping the free flow of people, goods, services, and investments among the provinces and territories. It said the barriers increased the cost of doing business in Canada. That meant that in some cases, it would be easier for a non-Canadian business to trade with Canada than it would be for businesses in some provinces and territories to trade within Canada.


	  The main problems the committee identified were internal trade barriers and variations in regulatory requirements across the country. While the barriers affected a “wide range of areas,” the worst hit were transportation, alcoholic beverages, and pharmaceutical drugs.


	  The senators urged the government of Canada to update the AIT, arguing that the new deal should take a negative-list approach, meaning it would cover everything not explicitly listed as exempt. That would compel governments to identify laws, regulations, and policies that go counter to the AIT and change the rules or seek an exemption. It would also mean any newly invented technologies and services would automatically be covered by the agreement.


	  The committee said that the agreement should also help trade across jurisdictions through mutual recognition. It praised the 2010 New West Partnership Trade Agreement between British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan for removing more internal barriers than the AIT had. It did so through mutual recognition, which means a person, good, service, or investment that meets the standards in one province or territory is automatically acceptable in any other province or territory.


	  Regulatory harmonization would mean the federal government worked with provincial and territorial governments to align different standards so Canada would maintain a high regulatory standard that didn’t interrupt trade.


	  “As a fundamental right, Canadians should be able to practise their profession or trade, operate a business whose goods and services can cross provincial/territorial borders, and purchase goods and services both freely and without penalty anywhere in this great country,” the committee wrote.


	  At the Senate
committee, a Statistics Canada official reported that between 1981 and 2014, the value of interprovincial trade in Canada grew by 4.2 per cent and that GDP had grown by 5.3 per cent over that time. As well, international imports grew by 6.2 per cent and international exports by 6.1 per cent.

	  Internally, the biggest gains went to Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The gains came mostly from internal trade of natural resources such as crude petroleum, potash, and other minerals. Statistics Canada reported the lowest gains went to Quebec and Ontario, which relied more on manufactured goods and on services.


	  The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses reported that by 2014, 46 per cent of small businesses had sales in another province or territory in the previous three years; 73 per cent had made purchases in another province or territory.


	  CFIB said the barriers came under three main categories: prohibitive barriers, technical barriers, and regulatory or administrative barriers. That meant, for example, that businesses were prohibited from shipping alcohol directly to consumers (prohibitive barriers); struggled to meet differing regulations in different jurisdictions (technical barriers); and had to complete extra paperwork to show companies meet standards in each jurisdiction (administrative barriers).


	  Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial government leaders created the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, which took effect on Canada Day, 2017. The new deal includes all areas of economic activity in the country, except for areas explicitly listed in the agreement. The exceptions are listed in part seven of the deal. The full list of exceptions takes up 135 pages of the agreement. CFTA does not affect existing Indigenous or treaty rights of any Indigenous people, including land-claims agreements. It also exempts sectors including taxation, water, and tobacco control.


	  The federal government said the deal covers “most” of the service economy, which provides about 70 per cent of Canada’s GDP. It also includes the energy sector.


	  CFTA does not address inter-governmental barriers to trading alcohol, but established a working group to study the issue and make recommendations to enhance its trade within Canada. Companies cannot ship alcoholic beverages directly to customers in other provinces or territories and each jurisdiction limits how much alcohol individuals can import from another province or territory.

	  In 2012, a New Brunswick man was charged with bringing too much alcohol from Quebec into his home province. He was acquitted when a provincial court found such limits to violate Section 121 of the 1867 constitution. The case was brought to the Supreme Court of Canada. (see Court System
of Canada). In April 2018, the court ruled unanimously that provinces and
territories have the constitutional right to restrict the importation of goods
across provincial and territorial borders, so long as the restriction does
not impede trade.

	  CFTA also established a working group to consider trade in fish and fish products. Both groups must report back in 2018, after which time the signatories will decide on any more changes.


	  The signatories also agreed to further study rules covering financial services and the territorial food sector, with any further changes coming in 2018.


	  The government says internal trade accounts for about 20 per cent of Canada’s yearly GDP, adding up to $385 billion annually. It also represents about 40 per cent of provincial and territorial exports. The Bank of Canada projected that removing internal trade barriers would have a similar economic impact to Canada’s signing of CETA.


	  CFTA made it easier for Canadian companies to bid on government contracts in other provinces or territories. It lets companies do so on contracts valued at more than $25,000; European countries covered by CETA face higher barriers.


	  CFTA increased the level of financial penalties that can be imposed in cases where governments act against the agreement. The fines are tied to population, and while the Agreement on Internal Trade’s maximum penalty was $5 million, the new maximum fine is $10 million.


	  The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses surveyed its members before the new deal took effect and found that complicated tax rules, high shipping costs and conflicting regulations posed the greatest challenges to internal trade. That includes different trucking rules (transportation regulation), different certification regulations for food, and standards within the construction industry. CFTA will work to align those rules across the country. It also established a regulatory reconciliation and cooperation table to eliminate existing barriers and prevent the creation of new ones.


	  The provinces and territories must still negotiate common standards to eliminate the barriers. Any province that disagrees with the common standard can opt out.

Car Fuel Efficiency Toughened;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/car-fuel-efficiency-toughened;It has been a long time since a Canadian government tried to force the auto industry to improve fuel efficiency.

	  It has been a long time since a Canadian government tried to force the auto industry to improve fuel efficiency. The energy crisis scares of the 1970s were still fresh memories when Pierre Trudeau's Liberals passed the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Standards Act in 1982. The law would have given Ottawa the power to set minimum kilometres-per-litre rules, and to fine automakers who failed to meet them. But although Parliament passed the act, it was never proclaimed into law. Instead, after intense lobbying by the powerful car and truck companies, the Trudeau government agreed to let the industry meet targets voluntarily. Since then, the federal approach has been to dutifully - critics would say meekly - follow the U.S. lead on fuel efficiency standards.


	  At least up until now. In what could turn out to be a bold reversal of policy, Ottawa is again making noises about going it alone. Senior federal officials say they will begin negotiations in September with the big automakers with the aim of arriving at new home-grown standards next year. And the feds' opening bargaining position is ambitious enough to have the industry's lobbyists very jumpy: a 25-per-cent improvement in fuel economy by 2010 for both passenger cars and the light trucks category, which includes popular minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickups. Peter Reilly-Roe, assistant director of the Transportation Energy Use Division of Natural Resources Canada, admits that target is open to negotiation. ""That's certainly what we'd like to get,"" he says.


	  Not if the automakers have their way. Not even close. The industry claims any separate Canadian standards would badly hurt manufacturing efficiency by fragmenting the North American market. The manufacturing process would become more complex - and more costly - if special Canadian requirements had to be taken into account. Mark Nantais, president of the Canadian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, warns that Canadian car buyers would bear the burden of the policy: small production runs of models designed to meet the new standards might cost more, and the available selection of bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles might shrink. ""If they are serious about pursuing unique requirements for Canada, the entire automobile industry is very concerned,"" he says. ""What that means in terms of North America is that they are starting to dismantle the integrated industry."" The implications go beyond the issues for car buyers that Nantais stresses to the prospect of lost manufacturing jobs - a politically explosive prospect for the big Liberal Ontario caucus.


	  But Nantais doubts the government will push the file that far. His view is shared by some of the most prominent voices on the other side of the debate - environmental activists who want the Liberals to get tough. ""I don't have much confidence,"" says Peter Tabuns, executive director of Greenpeace Canada, which released a major study making the case for more stringent vehicle emissions regulations earlier this year. ""The federal government's credibility is very low.""


	  Just how much political muscle gets thrown behind the push for new standards will depend largely on the cluster of cabinet ministers involved. Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal's department is spearheading the negotiations, but two other key Liberals might turn out to be even more important. Environment Minister David Anderson badly needs a daring new departure to inject some life into his struggle to devise a mix of policies to cut Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, especially if Prime Minister Jean Chrétien decides to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty this fall. Anderson's enthusiasm for cars that sip rather than swill gasoline is well known: he eschews the usual spacious ministerial sedan in favour of Toyota's petite Prius. But Transport Minister David Collenette, as a powerful Ontario voice at the cabinet table, will be under pressure from his home province's auto sector to fight back.


	  Ironically, it is developments in the U.S. that have revived the possibility of a Canadian code for fuel economy. According to Reilly-Roe, Ottawa remained more than willing to continue to harmonize with U.S. standards until it became clear a few months ago that Washington, with a one-time Texas oilman in the White House, was abandoning any thought of stricter fuel economy measures this year. In March, the U.S. Senate voted not to set specific new targets for the auto industry as part of a wider energy plan. That plan is still before Congress, but there is next to no chance of any last-minute reintroduction of significant fuel efficiency measures. ""It isn't clear exactly what they are going to do, but it isn't going to be much,"" Reilly-Roe says. ""We're going to try to get a lot more.""


	  If Canadian policy-makers are feeling bolder, they may be taking their lead from that perennial trend-setter, California. On July 2, California's state assembly passed a law that will dramatically limit auto emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas that scientists say is building up in the atmosphere and causing global warming. The automakers are being given lots of time to adjust; the tighter restrictions won't apply to new models of cars and trucks until 2009. Still, the industry mounted a ferocious campaign against the California law, including an advertisement that claimed, ""Supporters of this legislation just don't want you driving SUVs, pickups and minivans. If they really had their way, they wouldn't let you drive at all."" Having lost the battle at the political level, automakers are now vowing to launch a court challenge arguing the state has overstepped its jurisdiction.


	  California's trail-blazing is top of mind for advocates of a similar Canadian approach. ""It starts in California and Canada and rolls out from there,"" proposes Ken Ogilvie, executive director of Pollution Probe. ""We're a big enough market, similar to California,"" says Elly Meister, vice-president of public affairs for the Canadian Automobile Association, which supports Natural Resources' fuel efficiency improvement proposal. The CAA doesn't accept the auto industry's case that a Canada-only regulation, with vehicles outfitted especially for this market, would end up costing Canadian car buyers more. Meister says flatly, ""I've never bought that argument.""


	  Just how difficult it would be to achieve one-quarter better fuel economy by 2010 is a hotly debated subject. The target would apply to the average efficiency of vehicles in two categories. Under the current guidelines, all cars sold by each manufacturer must average no more than 8.6 litres/100 km, and all light trucks, including SUVs and minivans, no more than 11.4 litres/100 km. A 25-per-cent improvement would drop those averages to 6.5 litres/100 km for cars and 8.6 litres/100 km for the light truck group. Manufacturers might hit the targets through a mix of new technology and changing marketing strategies to boost sales of smaller vehicles. Because a wide range of vehicles are lumped together to calculate the average, no fuel-efficiency minimum would be imposed on specific models. There could still be muscle-bound 4x4s and fast cars for drivers with Indy fantasies - as long as enough of the new models put into showrooms did their bit to lower the overall fuel-burning average.


	  Nantais argues there's no easy way for Canada to take the lead, and pleads for patience. While the decision by the U.S. Congress not to proceed with new standards may be frustrating, he says, it's only a matter of time before the issue makes its way back onto Washington's agenda. The question is whether Ottawa will wait to see what happens whenever U.S. lawmakers next tackle the issue, or, after two decades in neutral, finally gears up a made-in-Canada policy.


	  The cars and light trucks sold in Canada have a wide range of fuel efficiencies. Most of the Top 10 selling models in 2002 fall somewhere in between. How they rank from the most to the least fuel-efficient for both city and highway driving:


	  MODEL RANK IN SALES LITRES/100 KM

Carbon Pricing in Canada;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/carbon-pricing-in-canada;"Carbon pricing refers to a cost that is imposed on the combustion of fossil fuels used by industry and consumers. Pricing can be set either directly through a carbon tax or indirectly through a cap-and-trade market system. A price on carbon is intended
	to capture the public costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and shift the burden for damage back to the original emitters, compelling them to reduce emissions. In 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a national climate change policy that includes a system of carbon pricing
	across Canada. Provinces can either create their own systems to meet federal requirements or have a federal carbon tax imposed on them. Nine provinces and territories	have their own carbon pricing plans that meet federal requirements. Ottawa has imposed its own carbon tax in Alberta, Saskatchewan,
	Manitoba and Ontario.";"Coal-fired power plant (© Andreas Altenburger/Dreamstime)
Carbon tax: In the case of a carbon tax, a state directly charges money to companies that burn or distribute fossil fuels (typically per unit of carbon emissions). Companies
	may pass on the cost to consumers; as a result, a carbon tax can raise prices for gasoline and home heating fuel.
Cap-and-trade: A cap-and-trade system creates a market for carbon emissions. A state imposes a limit — or a “cap” — on total carbon emissions within its jurisdiction. The limit drops over time to meet an emissions goal. Companies then trade permits
	with each other in a regulated market system.




Climate scientists have warned governments for decades about the potential consequences of releasing greenhouse
	gases into the atmosphere. (See Climate Change; Climate and Society.) In 1998,
	the government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien signed the Kyoto Protocol, agreeing
	to reduce emissions to six per cent below 1990 levels by the end of 2012. The Kyoto Protocol allowed for “emissions trading” — commonly known as cap-and-trade — between countries to keep global emissions below a set limit. However, the Liberal	governments of Chrétien and Paul Martin did not implement a carbon pricing system to meet those targets.
Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper opposed the Kyoto protocol when he came
	to power in 2006. His government formally withdrew from the accord in 2011. At that time, Canada’s emissions were 30 per cent above its Kyoto target. For the rest of the Harper period, Canada undertook few actions to reduce carbon emissions.
During the 2015 federal election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised to
	implement a Canada-wide carbon pricing plan; it would allow provinces to impose their own plans as long as they met federal standards. After he was elected, Trudeau and
	several provincial premiers attended the Paris climate summit in December 2015. The summit ended with an international agreement to limit the average global temperature increase
	to 2°C above preindustrial levels. To fulfill its side of the agreement, Canada promised to reduce GHG emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.




Before the Trudeau government proposed its national carbon pricing plan, some Canadian provinces had already created their own carbon pricing programs.
In 2007, Alberta began charging $15 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions beyond a set limit. In 2015, the province’s newly elected New Democratic Party	(NDP) government under Premier Rachel Notley introduced a carbon tax plan; it increased the price on
	emissions to $20 per tonne in 2017 and $30 per tonne in 2018. In 2019, however, the United Conservative Party (UCP) government under Jason Kenney	cancelled Alberta’s carbon tax.
Quebec, too, was an early adopter. It introduced a modest carbon tax starting in 2007 and a cap-and-trade program starting in 2013. Under that system, Quebec joined with California
	in a “carbon market” that allows companies to buy and sell emission permits issued by the province and the state.
British Columbia introduced Canada’s first broad-based carbon tax in 2008. It covers gasoline and home heating fuels as well as industrial activities. It was initially set
	at $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted and rose to $40 per tonne by 2019. The tax was due to reach $50 per tonne by 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province only
	increased it to $45 per tonne on 1 April 2021. An increase to $50 was scheduled for 1 April 2022. The BC tax was originally “revenue-neutral.” This meant it was used to reduce other taxes. But the province now plans to use money from the tax to provide
	rebates to families and invest in climate change solutions.
Ontario joined the Quebec-California cap-and-trade market in 2018. However, Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne was replaced by Progressive Conservative	premier Doug Ford later that year. Ford cancelled Ontario’s cap-and-trade program during his first week in office.




At a first ministers conference in Vancouver in March 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the premiers reached an agreement on the need for a national strategy to meet Canada’s
	2030 emission reduction target. In the Vancouver Declaration, issued on 3 March, the premiers committed to “transition to a low carbon economy by adopting a broad range of domestic measures, including carbon pricing mechanisms, adapted to each province’s
	and territory’s specific circumstances.…”
After months of debate and continued disagreement among the provinces, Trudeau announced the federal government’s new carbon pricing plan in October 2016. Ottawa would
	require all provinces and territories to have a carbon pricing system in place. For provinces using a carbon tax, the tax needed to be at least $10 per tonne at the start, then rise by $10 per year until it reached $50 per tonne in 2022. For provinces
	choosing a cap-and-trade approach, the emissions cap had to be lowered over time so Canada could meet its 2030 GHG target.
For provinces that did not meet the federal requirements, Ottawa would impose its own tax on the province. However, Trudeau promised that any money raised from a federal tax would go back to the provincial government	to be used as they saw fit.
In April 2019, the federal government imposed a carbon tax on Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario	and New Brunswick. Prince Edward Island, Nunavut	and Yukon opted to use the federal program in-part or whole. The rest of the provinces already had programs that met the federal requirements. New Brunswick later switched to an approved
	provincial carbon pricing plan. Alberta cancelled its carbon tax with the election of UCP leader Jason Kenney in 2019 and began paying a federal carbon tax of $20 per tonne on 1 January 2020; it was set to increase to $30 per tonne in April 2020 and
	to $50 per tonne by 2022.




The federal plan was met with significant opposition, especially from Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall and Manitoba’s Brian Pallister.
	Saskatchewan took the federal government to court, claiming that Ottawa does not have the right under the Constitution	to impose carbon pricing on the provinces. Two other challenges were launched by the Progressive Conservative government of Ontario and
	the UCP government in Alberta. The three separate appeals made their way through provincial courts to the Supreme Court of Canada.
	On 25 March 2021, the Court found that the federal carbon tax is constitutional, ruling against the provinces in a 6–3 decision.
In late 2020, the Trudeau government increased its GHG emissions target to 32–40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. To hit this target, it proposed raising the federal carbon price by $15 per year after 2022, reaching $170 per tonne in 2030. The government
	also proposed a law that would bind Canada to a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.




Carbon pricing is somewhat of an economic experiment. (See also Economic Regulation.)
	The long-term economic impacts are not yet clear, nor is it perfectly understood how high a tax needs to be to reduce emissions. Critics of a carbon tax, such as members of Saskatchewan’s provincial government, argue that it is an unfair burden on consumers
	and makes provinces less competitive.
A World Bank review in 2016 found that a carbon tax had little impact on a jurisdiction’s economic competitiveness. A 2015 study of the carbon tax in British Columbia suggested that the tax successfully reduced emissions while having a “negligible” impact
	on economic activity. However, the tax had been frozen at $30 per tonne since 2012, and it did hurt some emissions-heavy industries such as cement production.

Career Counselling;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/career-counselling;One of the major responsibilities of schools is to prepare students for employment and one of the ways they achieve this is through career counselling.;"One of the major responsibilities of schools is to prepare students for employment and one of the ways they achieve this is through career counselling. Guidance counsellors are specialized teachers hired by secondary schools to help students in making educational and personal decisions about career opportunities. 
Counsellors sometimes teach guidance courses, which introduce students to issues in the work world, and sometimes administer tests or provide other means of assisting students in matching their skills to job requirements. They may organize work experience for students or provide career-education materials for classroom use. The motivation to provide career counselling developed from early 20th-century educational reforms. Provision for the appointment of guidance counsellors was first made in 1921 in the Ontario Vocational Education Act. The number and role of counsellors gradually increased in all the provinces, but it was not until the 1960s that specialized guidance personnel were well established.
Vocational guidance has been controversial since its inception. Many have challenged the need for schools to play a vocational rather than simply an academic role. Others have wondered what the best mechanisms are for informing students about and preparing them for the labour market. When youth unemployment increases, counsellors have been criticized for lacking sufficient information about the job market and for being ineffective. Some efforts have been made to shift career counselling to outside the schools, eg, into employment information centres. Other attempts have been made to increase its presence in the curriculum as a compulsory course. In the 1990s there has been an increased emphasis on work experience and career planning in most provinces.
Counsellors tend to have most information about and to orient students towards postsecondary education and professional/white-collar jobs, despite the origins of counselling in vocational education. This social class bias in the counselling system, and the tendency for counsellors to differentially advise students from more privileged homes, has been the cause for some concern. Racial and ethnic biases may also enter too easily into the system. The process of providing encouragement for young women to enter a wider variety of workplaces, especially those involving mathematics and science, also puts important demands for equity on the shoulders of career counsellors."
Career counselling;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/career-counselling-emc;Career counselling. Musically talented children wishing to study music seriously usually receive counselling from their music teachers, both private and school.;"Career counselling. Musically talented children wishing to study music seriously usually receive counselling from their music teachers, both private and school. There are no sufficiently valid musical aptitude tests, despite widespread efforts to develop them, and few are used consistently in Canada. Written evaluations and comments by conservatory examiners and festival adjudicators are often an important factor to help influence children - and their parents - in choosing music as a vocation.
Professional music schools in Canada (universities, conservatories, and community colleges) offer couses in classical, popular, and jazz performance; theory and composition; musicology; and music education. Students can elect these courses by passing entrance examinations. However little is done to inform them of the supply and demand for specialists in these subjects in the musical and educational marketplace.
Few schools prepare students for fields such as popular music arranging; music publishing; musical instrument manufacture; radio, record, television, and film production, direction and engineering; music criticism; music therapy; music librarianship; archival and museum curating; concert managing; and musical publicity, marketing and musical media work, none of which require concert-calibre performance skills, although courses in some of these areas are available at some of thecommunity colleges. Music students are often ill-prepared to seek out these alternative careers, despite the growing number of positions in these fields. Rather, they enter traditional careers, eg, teach in a school or a private studio, play in an orchestra, sing in an opera company, play and conduct in a church, or teach in post-secondary schools. Music graduates in general tend to lack the awareness and flexibility necessary in a highly competetive musical marketplace.
On occasion courses have been given in Canada to young classical professional performing musicians to develop communication skills, musical and non-musical, in order to help them to be more employable and to build new audiences (eg, in the Music Performance and Communcation program held 1987-90 at the University of Toronto). Such courses have included workshops in improvisation, special programming, stagecraft, acting, movement, speech, neurolinguistics, and music therapy, and seminars in contracting, publicity and other aspects of business and music. Practical texts have also been published to aid musicians to prepare for auditions for orchestra posts and, once attained, to keep them.
The supply of traditionally-trained musicians has continued to increase while the demand for them has decreased. Music educators have given insufficient attention to the growing influence of technology and the outlets it provides in a changing and complex musical world. In order to rectify this situation appropriate career counselling should be more readily available to music students."

	Child labour is defined as the regular employment of boys and girls under the age of 15 or 16. Attitudes toward child labour have altered dramatically since the late 18th century, when it was generally assumed that children should contribute to the family
	economy from about age seven. By the beginning of the 20th century most provinces had enacted labour legislation to restrict the employment of children.


	Prior to the 19th century, children were often seen as economic assets to families. In most cases, this meant assisting parents, but it could also entail paid employment outside the home. Such activity might include the acquisition of skills useful in
	adulthood, possibly such as a formal apprenticeship. Child labour made an important contribution to Aboriginal culture and to the societies of New France and early English Canada.
	However, during the 19th and early 20th centuries most Canadian children became economic liabilities to their families. Boys' and girls' time was increasingly taken up securing a formal education. By 1911 about 40 per cent of Canadian children aged five
	to nine, and 50 per cent of 10-to19-year-olds were in school. As the percentage of children attending school increased, the proportion of boys aged 14-19 who were gainfully employed dropped from 68 per cent in 1921 to 40 per cent in 1961.


Industrialization and urbanization in the mid-19th century opened up more opportunities of paid
	employment for children who were not in school. The proportion of urban residents grew from about 17 per cent at Confederation in 1867 to over one-third by 1901, and to almost
	one-half by 1921. In major urban centres, children could find employment in Montréal textile mills, Hamilton businesses, mines in Cape Breton and British Columbia, and small manufacturing enterprises in the Maritimes. Still, many jobs for children were
	considered ""dead end"" — poorly paid, menial positions without any opportunity for advancement. Some positions, such as those of messenger boy and newspaper vendor, did not lead to adult employment. Moreover, most children holding jobs came from working-class
	backgrounds.


	Social reformers of this era were concerned with child labour and were intent on improving Canadian society. As well as supporting compulsory schooling and measures to combat juvenile delinquency, reformers sought to ban child labour. The first wave of
	provincial legislation regulating child labour in factories and mines began to pass in the 1870s and 1880s. But the prohibition of child labour did not come until the 20th century.


	Several conditions combined to restrict and eventually end child labour in Canada. By the beginning of the 20th century most provinces had enacted labour laws to restrict the employment of children. Legislation restricting child employment in mines was
	enacted in Nova Scotia in 1873, and British Columbia in 1877. By 1929 children under 14 had been legally excluded from factory and mine employment in most provinces.


	From the early 1870s to the mid-1920s all the provinces enacted legislation requiring school attendance. Sanctions were imposed on families that did not comply. In 1891, Ontario legislation required compulsory school attendance for eight-to-14-year-old
	children. In 1921, the Adolescent School Attendance Act increased the age of compulsory attendance in urban areas to 16. Following compulsory attendance, provinces gradually restricted child employment by the age of the child and by requiring students
	to pass through minimum grade levels. Although exemptions were common, legislation was designed so that compulsory education and labour restrictions were mutually supportive.


	During the Great Depression, many adults sought jobs formerly done largely by children. During the Second World War,
	however, many children entered the workforce, defying school-attendance legislation. Since the war, it has been argued, women replaced children as part-time contributors to family income.


	Child labour persisted into the 20th century in less visible forms. Between Confederation and the mid-1920s, about 80,000 British children, most under 14, were brought to Canada by humanitarian organizations wishing to give them a new start away from
	their working-class backgrounds. Most were apprenticed to rural families, and in general, became child labourers rather than adopted children. Growing sensitivity to their fate led to the prohibition of child immigration	in 1925.


	In 1926, the International Labour Organization (ILO) established a convention that defined slavery as ""...the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised...."" and identified child
	labour. By 1930 the convention was broadened to specifically define forced labour. Convention 29, the Forced Labour Convention (1930), supplemented the convention to include the abolition of slavery, the slave trade, and institutions and practices similar
	to slavery or forced labour. Canada helped develop the convention but was one of only nine countries that did not ratify it. It wasn’t until 1959 that Canada ratified ILO Convention 105, the Abolition of Forced Labour, which specifically prohibits forced
	or compulsory labour as a means of political coercion.


	In 2000 Canada ratified the international Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work treaty, which opposes the worst forms of child labour such as trafficking, recruitment of child soldiers and prostitution. As of 2013, Canada still has
	yet to ratify ILO Convention 138, which aims to establish a minimum age of 17 for working children.


	Today in Canada, work outside school hours is generally allowed. However, for children under 16, school attendance is compulsory and employment is restricted. The legislation governing minimum age, number of working hours per day and the time of day that
	a youth may work varies between the provinces and territories. Some provinces require parental permission for a minor to be employed. Legislation also exists to protect minors from working under dangerous or hazardous conditions, such as in the mining
	industry, manufacturing, construction, forestry, and where liquor is sold or kept for sale.

Cigarette Packaging;https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cigarette-packaging;"This article was originally published in Maclean’s  magazine on January 31, 2000. Partner content is not updated.

Perhaps, but if Rock gets his way cigarette packaging is about to go from colourful and cool to downright disturbing.";"Perhaps, but if Rock gets his way cigarette packaging is about to go from colourful and cool to downright disturbing. The changes, considered to be among the toughest proposed anywhere in the world, would force manufacturers to dedicate half the front panel of every cigarette pack to any of 16 shocking images. Aside from stark close-ups of tumours, they include a pregnant woman smoking along with the slogan ""Cigarettes hurt babies,"" and a drooping cigarette labelled ""Tobacco use can make you impotent."" In addition, a leaflet inside the package will list the toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke and advise smokers how to kick their habit. With more than two billion cigarette packs printed annually in Canada, it will amount to the biggest public-health campaign ever launched here. ""Canadians who use tobacco,"" said Rock, ""need to fully understand the serious health hazard inherent in this lethal product.""
Not surprisingly, the tobacco industry said it intends to block Rock's proposals before they are to go into effect next year. Industry spokesman Rob Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, said Rock's plan is unworkable because the companies that print the packages cannot produce the new images the minister wants. Printing industry executives swiftly contradicted Parker, however, saying they could duplicate the images. But Parker also questioned whether the stark warnings are necessary. ""People smoke because they are risk-takers,"" he said. ""Risk is part of the pleasure of smoking.""
Increasing awareness of the risks associated with smoking is precisely what Rock has in mind. Health officials believe the printed warnings that have been on cigarette packages since 1994 have lost much of the impact they might have had. During the past decade, the number of smokers has fallen slightly, from 30 per cent of Canadians over the age of 15, to 25 per cent. But at the same time, the number of teenage smokers has increased to 28 per cent of that age group from 21 per cent.
Seeking to determine if a different approach to packaging could help reduce smoking further, Health Canada hired Toronto-based Environics Research Group Ltd. in 1998 to sample public opinion. In five separate studies - four among adults and one among young people aged 12 to 18 - the firm found all groups considered graphic warnings to have far more impact than printed notices. That was particularly true among the young, Environics reports, with 88 per cent under 18 saying the new images would be a greater deterrent. Julia Ford, a 17-year-old non-smoker at Jarvis Collegiate, agrees. ""The pictures might not make you quit if you already smoke,"" she says, ""but they could stop you from starting.""
In addition to their shock value, the new images are part of a larger campaign to deglamorize smoking and make it socially unacceptable. Cigarettes retain an aura of legitimacy, says Roberta Ferrence, director of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit at the University of Toronto, in part because they are sold from attractive, colourful displays, often located near milk, bread and other healthy products. But when store shelves are lined with cigarette packages portraying the ugly results of smoking, she adds, people may begin to recognize tobacco for the deadly product that it is.
The new packaging plan also got a thumbs-up from Richard Pollay, a marketing professor at the University of British Columbia, who feels it could fundamentally change how consumers view cigarettes. ""The packages will no longer be a symbol of status,"" said Pollay, a leading expert on tobacco advertising, ""particularly among teenagers."" First, however, the new regulations must be put into effect - and both the Reform party and the NDP have voiced their support. Then they will likely face a court challenge from the tobacco industry. But as she puffs on her cigarette in a Toronto mall, Teresa Palmer, 25, says she wishes the graphic warnings had been around earlier, when she got hooked. ""When you're a teenager,"" she says, ""you never think you will die."" The new cigarette packages just might help drive home a stark lesson in life.

Cod Moratorium of 1992;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cod-moratorium-of-1992;"On 2 July 1992, the federal government banned cod fishing along Canada’s east coast. This moratorium
	ended nearly five centuries of cod fishing in Newfoundland and Labrador. Cod had played a central role in the province’s economy and culture.
The aim of the policy was to help restore cod stocks that had been depleted due to overfishing. Today, the cod population remains too low to support a full-scale fishery.
	For this reason, the ban is still largely in place.
Click here for definitions of key terms used in this article.";"The lndigenous peoples of what is now Newfoundland did some fishing. But these
	peoples, including the Dorset and Beothuk, mainly used the ocean to hunt seals,
	seabirds and shellfish.
Most large-scale fishing activity developed after John Cabot’s voyage of 1497. Cabot’s crew reportedly claimed that there were so many cod around Newfoundland that one could catch
	them simply by lowering a basket into the water. By the mid-1500s, fishing vessels from Britain, France, Spain and Portugal regularly crossed the Atlantic to fish for cod. North Atlantic cod — salted and dried for preservation — accounted for more than
	half of all the fish eaten in Europe. The seasonal fishing outposts Europeans used gradually became permanent settlements.
Fishing practices remained largely unchanged for the next several centuries. Gradually, however, a local, inshore fishing industry grew up alongside international offshore fishing.
After the Second World War, there were major advances in fishing technology. These advances included better nets and sonar	for finding fish. New “factory freezer” trawlers could stay at sea for months at a time. With these new tools, it was possible to catch many more fish. On the Grand Banks,
	the main fishing zone off Newfoundland, the groundfish catch steadily rose. Most of this catch was cod. The yield peaked at 810,000 tons in 1968. Later estimates suggest that the harvestable
	biomass of cod (fish large enough to be caught and eaten) dropped by 82 per cent between 1962 and 1977.
On 1 January 1977, Canada extended its fishing limits to 200 nautical miles (370 km) off its coast. (See History of Commercial Fisheries.) This was
	partly a measure to reduce foreign fishing of cod. Overall catches did drop briefly as foreign boats left the area. But the new rules did little to prevent Canadians from catching more and more in waters where they alone now fished. Newfoundland’s cod
	industry grew markedly thanks to the new rules. In 1975, the province had 15,000 fishers and 110 fish processing plants. By 1980, it had 35,000 fishers and 175 processing plants.
It was the job of scientists at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to estimate the amount of cod being caught. In the 1980s, these scientists arrived at their estimates through a flawed process. As a result, they set quotas that were too high
	to make the fishery sustainable. Government officials also often raised these quotas to sate economic needs. In 1986 or 1987, the Newfoundland Inshore Fisheries Association (NIFA)
	commissioned a report on the DFO’s estimates. The report suggested that the DFO was overestimating the number of cod left by more than 100 per cent. The NIFA launched a lawsuit that sparked an internal review at the DFO. In 1989, the internal review
	confirmed the findings of the NIFA report. This prompted scientists to recommend a 50 per cent reduction in quota levels. The federal government ignored the recommendation.
By 1992, the spawning biomass stock (individuals of breeding age) of northern cod had fallen to just 1 per cent of its estimated peak. Fisheries and Oceans minister John Crosbie	responded to the clear evidence of decline. He announced a two-year moratorium on cod fishing on 2 July. Protesters who opposed the ban tried to break into the room where the news conference was held. The previous day, they had also confronted Crosbie
	in the streets of Bay Bulls, Newfoundland.
The government later extended the ban with no end date in sight. It made an exemption, though, for a small stewardship fishery.
The moratorium was the largest layoff in Canadian history. It affected some 40,000 fishers and related workers. In Newfoundland and Labrador alone, nearly 30,000
	people lost their jobs. The government introduced the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program (NCARP). Through NCARP, workers received employment insurance payments
	and retraining. They largely viewed it as inadequate, however. Newfoundland and Labrador’s population dropped by 10 per cent in the first decade of the ban as people left the province for lack of work. (See also Unemployment in Canada.)
Unable to pursue cod, the fishing industry turned to shellfish, particularly snow crab and lobster. This offset
	some of the financial impacts. But the province’s fishing industry has still never recovered to the heights of the mid-1980s. (At that time, cod alone were worth about $700 million to the economy	and Canada was the largest exporter of seafood in the world.) In the early 2000s, scientists began warning that snow crab stocks were showing signs of decline. In 2017, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans announced the snow crab population had declined
	by more than 80 per cent in less than four years.
In 2008, scientists noted the first substantial increase in cod since 1992. Some research published in 2015 suggested northern cod may finally be making enough of a recovery to end the moratorium. Acting on this research, policy-makers
	raised stewardship quotas. Between 2017 and 2018, however, the stock dropped by as much as 30 per cent."
Collective Bargaining;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/collective-bargaining;Collective bargaining is a method of jointly determining working conditions between one or more employers on one side and organized employees on the other.;"
	Collective bargaining is a method of jointly determining working conditions between one or more employers on one side and organized employees on the other. The normal outcome is a collective agreement outlining terms and conditions of employment as well as issues such as union recognition, grievance procedure and special committees.


	In North America a union must be certified as a bargaining unit; ie, prove it has the support of an absolute majority (50% + 1) of the employees before it may represent them in collective bargaining. Government administrative bodies have the power to verify the representative nature of the unions and may call for a vote to determine whether a majority of employees in a specifically defined bargaining unit wish to be represented by a union. In Canada, the Provinces have jurisdiction over labour matters except for some industries which are regulated by the federal government like transportation and broadcasting.


	Collective bargaining involves two parties that have conflicting as well as converging interests. Conflict arises out of the clash of economic interests between workers seeking job and income security and employers seeking to obtain organizational effectiveness. Because this conflict is viewed as inherent in the structure of the employment relationship, overt conflicts in the form of strikes and lockouts are considered as a logical outgrowth of a system that seeks to allow the parties to pursue their pluralistic goals. These conflicts, however, are not pathological. They are limited in scope and frequency because neither party can achieve its goals without the other and because the parties share a number of common goals, such as health and safety at work, for example.


	The negotiating process comprises four sub-processes: distributive bargaining, integrative bargaining, shaping intergroup attitudes, and managing internal differences. Distributive bargaining has the function of resolving pure conflicts of interest. It serves to allocate fixed sums of resources (""dividing the pie"") and has a ""win-lose"" quality. Integrative bargaining has the function of finding common or complementary interests. It serves to optimize the potential for joint gains (""expanding the pie"") and has a win-win quality. Shaping intergroup attitudes refers to the way the parties influence attitudes (positive or negative) toward each other and the underlying norms and tone of their relationship. Finally, managing internal differences serves to either build consensus or encourage diversity of views within the interacting organizations.


	All provincial governments as well as the federal government have accepted the idea that it is in the public interest to permit and even encourage collective bargaining. In order to help the parties resolve their differences, these governments offer conciliation or mediation services.


	Although most unionized employees have a legally recognized right to strike, sometimes precisely defined waiting periods must be observed before a strike or lockout may begin. Certain groups, forbidden the right to strike, must submit their dispute to binding arbitration by a tribunal whose decision is final. Others must maintain a minimum number of employees at work during a work stoppage in order to provide for essential services. In some cases, governments have suspended strikes or lockouts, when they felt that such conflicts were endangering the public interest.


	Anything not contrary to law may be written into a collective agreement. In North America, collective agreements must have a specific duration which cannot be less than a year. Most jurisdictions do not impose a maximum duration, but the average length of a contract is approximately three years, although contracts covering longer periods became more frequent in the mid-1990s.


	Union achievements at the bargaining table often become part of legislation. After an autoworkers' strike in 1947, the basic principle of union recognition (commonly called the ""Rand Formula"") was established. Medical insurance in union contracts preceded national medicare, pensions preceded universal pension plans, safeguards against discrimination preceded human rights legislation.

Commercial Law;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/commercial-law;Commercial law is that branch of private law concerned primarily with the supply of goods or services by merchants and other businesses for profit. Textbooks on commercial law frequently differ on the range of topics treated in them.;"Commercial law is that branch of private law concerned primarily with the supply of goods or services by merchants and other businesses for profit. Textbooks on commercial law frequently differ on the range of topics treated in them. Any serious exposition of commercial law, however, will include such topics as sale of goods, bailment and carriage of goods, documents of title and negotiable instruments, banking, the various forms of secured credit, and BANKRUPTCY law. 
These topics are often linked through an originating transaction. For example, a seller selling goods to a buyer at a distant location will often have to make arrangements for their shipment; this will involve a contract of carriage for conveyance of the goods (by land or sea and, in overseas shipments, frequently both) with a carrier, who will issue the seller with a bill of lading (a ""document of title""), which may be negotiable or non-negotiable. During their transit the goods will also usually be covered by a policy of insurance (""inland"" or ""marine"" insurance) against loss or damage. In commercial transactions, the buyer will almost invariably make payment by means of a negotiable instrument, which in domestic transactions normally consists of a cheque drawn on the buyer's bank in the seller's favour. In international transactions payment will often be arranged through a banker's letter of credit. 
If the buyer cannot or does not wish to make immediate payment, the seller may give him a short period of credit. Alternatively the seller may be willing to sell the goods on a ""conditional sale"" basis, involving an extension of medium- or long-term credit while reserving title until the goods have been paid for; or the buyer may arrange for a loan from a financial institution and give security to the lender to secure repayment of the loan. If the buyer becomes bankrupt before the goods have been paid for, the seller will want to know whether he can recover the goods and, if he cannot, how the seller will rank with other creditors who have claims against the bankrupt's estate. 
In Canada jurisdiction to regulate commercial transactions is divided between the federal and the provincial governments, so commercial lawyers must be familiar with federal as well as provincial laws. A further complication arises because the commercial law of Québec is or was derived from the CIVIL CODE of France while the commercial law of the English-speaking provinces is largely based on English law. At both the provincial and federal levels the relevant rules of many of the principal branches of commercial law have been reduced to statutory form. Thus, all English-speaking provinces have a substantially identical Sale of Goods Act while the Bills of Exchange Act, the Bank Act, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act codify all or a substantial part of the areas of commercial law under federal jurisdiction. 
The function of sales law is primarily to determine the rights and duties of the seller and buyer where the contract itself does not contain a complete set of terms. The seller's obligations are generally the more onerous. The seller must not only deliver goods of the right quantity and description and at the agreed time; he must also supply goods that are of ""merchantable quality"" and reasonably fit for their intended purpose. The oft-quoted maxim caveat emptor (""let the buyer beware"") has long ceased to represent the Canadian law. If the seller fails to live up to his obligations he may have to compensate the buyer for the losses suffered by them, and these could be very substantial. However, well-drafted contracts almost invariably limit the seller's liability for defective goods. The buyer's primary obligations under the typical contract of sale are to accept the goods and to pay for them as agreed. 
The federal Bills of Exchange Act deals with the following types of payment instrument: bills of exchange, cheques (ie, bills of exchange drawn on a bank or recognized near-bank) and promissory notes. An important function of the Act is to regulate the assignability (ie, negotiability) of rights obtained under one of these instruments and to determine when the transferee of an instrument can obtain better rights to payment than its original holder had. The transferee is then said to be a ""holder in due course."" Similar principles of negotiability apply to ""documents of title,"" ie, recognized types of documents (such as bills of lading and warehouse receipts) that indicate that the holder of them is entitled to the delivery of goods by the bailee who issued the document in the first place. 
Canadian commercial law is changing rapidly in response to a variety of technological and other nonlegal factors. In the sales area, the courts and the legislatures are increasingly having to recognize that the typical retailer is only a conduit for the manufacturer, who produces the goods and creates a market for them through intensive advertising. There is strong pressure, therefore, to hold the manufacturer directly responsible to the ultimate buyer if the goods are defective, even though no formal contract exists between the parties. 
Negotiable-instruments law is deeply affected by the use of electronic systems for the transfer of funds (including the use of automated tellers at the retail level) and the widespread substitution of cheques by CREDIT CARDS. ""Debit cards,"" a process by which a purchaser's bank account is electronically debited with the price of a purchase or service at the point of purchase, are also beginning to make a substantial inroad into the use of cheques, although the ""cashless society"" is still some distance away. Containerization of cargoes and intermodal methods of transport have radically altered the law of bills of lading and the traditional roles and duties of carriers. 
The greatly increased importance of secured credit of all types is also contributing to changes in this branch of commercial law. In particular, 7 provinces (Ontario, all 4 western provinces, and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) and the Yukon and the Northwest Territories have now adopted a substantially similar Personal Property Security Act to replace the old provincial Conditional Sales, Chattel Mortgages, and Assignment of Book Debts Acts. The other common-law jurisdictions (PEI and Newfoundland) are expected to follow suit before the turn of the century. The new Québec Civil Code also contains elements of the same approach. "
Consumer and Corporate Affairs;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/consumer-and-corporate-affairs;The Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs was established in 1967 to bring together under one minister the administering of federal policies regulating the marketplace.;"The Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs was established in 1967 to bring together under one minister the administering of federal policies regulating the marketplace. Its responsibilities included consumer affairs; corporations and corporate securities; combines, mergers, monopolies and restraint of trade; bankruptcy and insolvency; patents, copyrights, trademarks and industrial design; and programs designed to promote the interests of Canadian consumers. The minister, as registrar general of Canada, was the custodian of the Great Seal of Canada, Privy Seal of the governor general and the seals of the administrator and registrar general of Canada. The department's Bureau of Competition Policy included the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission; the Bureau of Consumer Affairs was concerned with the fair treatment of consumers in the marketplace; the Bureau of Corporate Affairs regulated much of the legal framework in which business operates. In 1993 the department was dismantled in a structural overhaul of the government and its responsibilities delegated to other departments."
Consumer Law;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/consumer-law;The branch of law concerned with the supply of goods and services in the most comprehensive sense for the personal use or consumption of individuals and their families is called consumer law.;"The branch of law concerned with the supply of goods and services in the most comprehensive sense for the personal use or consumption of individuals and their families is called consumer law. It differs from COMMERCIAL LAW in that in commercial transactions the participants engage in such transactions for the purpose of profit or otherwise in the course of a business. Consumer law in the modern sense is only 30 years old. Its growth reflects the tremendous changes in lifestyles and in the products and services offered in the modern marketplace since WWII. 
Some of the important factors contributing to the rise of consumerism are the transition in North America from an agrarian to a predominantly urban lifestyle, mass production and the proliferation of new and often very complex products, a more affluent society with greater discretionary incomes, and the phenomenal growth of consumer credit. 
Concerns about the vulnerability of consumers are not new; significant traces of it are found in the Bible (in the condemnation of usury, for example) and throughout medieval and modern European history. 
In Canada both the Interest Act and the Food and Drugs Act, to give 2 important examples, originated in 19th-century concerns. Consumer problems today are more numerous and complex than those faced by consumers before WWII, and in most cases cannot be solved by an individual without governmental or other outside assistance. 
At the federal and provincial levels, departments or ministries of consumer affairs and consumer-protection bureaus were rapidly established from about 1965 onwards. The federal Department of CONSUMER AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS was established in 1967. The institutional changes have been accompanied by the adoption of much new consumer-protection legislation and the revision of older legislation. Generally speaking, existing legislation is designed to promote one or more of the following objectives. 
Federal examples of this type of legislation include the Food and Drugs Act, the Hazardous Products Act, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Motor Vehicle Tire Safety Act. Consumer protection is achieved by a variety of means, such as prohibiting the sale of dangerous, unsafe or adulterated products, limiting sales to prescribed outlets and on prescription, or by setting standards of safety and purity. 
The federal Weights and Measures Act is an early example of this type of legislation. More recent examples include the Competition Act with its important provisions concerning misleading advertising. From 1974 onwards a substantial number of the provinces also adopted ""trade practices"" or ""business practices"" acts with the same objectives but employing different enforcement techniques. 
Many modern contracts are standardized and sometimes contain harsh or unreasonable terms. The average consumer would not know of their existence and would be powerless to change them even if he or she knew they were there (see CONTRACT LAW). Legislation directed against this and related types of abuse include the previously mentioned trade practice acts, as well as warranty provisions in the provincial consumer-protection acts and Part V of the federal Bills of Exchange Act. The latter provisions deal with the use of negotiable instruments in consumer credit sales. 
Modern consumers are not always given sufficient information to make an informed choice between competing products or services, or else the information is presented in a confusing form. The ""truth in lending"" provisions in the provincial consumer-protection acts and the federal Banking Act (both now badly dated) are designed to provide the needed information in consumer-credit contracts. Important disclosure requirements with similar objectives are found in the federal Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and the Textile Labelling Act. 
Provincial consumer-protection bureaus have been created to provide general advice on consumer problems and to receive complaints. Community legal service clinics (now found in large cities across Canada) and, to a limited extent, provincial legal aid plans provide legal advice and other forms of assistance to those who cannot afford a private lawyer. 
At the judicial level the jurisdiction of the SMALL CLAIMS COURTS has been substantially increased with respect to the size of claims; also noteworthy are the important procedural innovations introduced in the Québec Access to Justice Act of 1971 and the Class Actions Act (the first in Canada) adopted in 1978. Class action legislation now also exists in Ontario and British Columbia. 
This description of postwar legislative developments may leave the impression that the modern Canadian consumer is well protected. The appearance is unfortunately misleading, and the picture is not as encouraging as a recitation of the legislation may suggest. The principal difficulty is that much of the legislation is only weakly enforced or not enforced at all. 
Some of the legislation is also poorly drafted. Most of the provincial consumer-protection agencies have always suffered from inadequate funding; since the early 1980s situation has become progressively worse and both the federal and provincial governments have reduced or eliminated important programs altogether. In 1993, the federal government ""merged"" the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs with the Department of Industry. Although ostensibly only an efficiency step, it in fact highlighted the demotion of consumer concerns to minor status at the federal level - a precedent which the provinces were only too ready to follow.
This anticlimax to the postwar period of intense legislative activity is explained by some critics on the ground that much of the legislation was never really needed or that, in some cases, it went too far. A more persuasive explanation is that consumers are not politically a cohesive group and cannot match opposing interest groups in effectiveness and resources, particularly during periods of economic adversity.

Consumer Standards;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/consumer-standards;Consumer standards are documents describing acceptable characteristics or usage for products, materials and services used by individual consumers. They may specify dimensional, performance or safety requirements for household products.;"Consumer standards are documents describing acceptable characteristics or usage for products, materials and services used by individual consumers. They may specify dimensional, performance or safety requirements for household products. In Canada standards are published by specialized private and government organizations grouped in the National Standards System, co-ordinated by the Standards Council of Canada. Standardization begins when public needs are recognized and involves field and laboratory research. The detailed work of writing a consumer standard is performed by volunteers representing a balance of all groups having an interest in the particular product, material or service. Such standards are known as consensus standards, as their final acceptance depends on substantial agreement among the participants. Standards are usually applied voluntarily. If governments pass laws making usage mandatory, they often simply refer to consensus standards, rather than specifying detailed technical requirements. 
The development of a consumer standard is one of the most difficult tasks of standardization. Part of the difficulty is identifying precisely the purpose of a standard for a particular product. For example, except for those regulating safety of operation, no Canadian standard yet exists for television sets because of the difficulty of agreeing on the requirements that the standard should cover. 
Consumer groups (eg, the CONSUMERS' ASSOCIATION OF CANADA) are actively involved in the standardization process. Consumer representatives have been participating in standards-writing groups or committees since the 1950s. Standardization professionals generally agree on the necessity of having adequate consumer representation during the preparation of standards affecting consumer products. Because of the somewhat limited role consumer representatives have had in standards-writing committees, and because of consumers' ever-growing demands to be more involved in the standards-writing process, consumer advisory panels have been set up. Each panel consists of 30-40 individuals who meet regularly to study, comment and make recommendations regarding a particular consumer standard. Through the Standards Council of Canada, consumer representatives also participate in international standardization work. They are represented on the Committee on Consumer Policy (COPOLCO), a committee of the International Standards Organization (ISO). 
In Canada one of the better-known series of consumer standards pertains to children's clothing sizes, prepared by the then Canadian Government Specifications Board (CGSB, now Canadian General Standards Board) at the request of the Consumers' Association of Canada. This series demanded one of the most exhaustive technical investigations ever carried out in Canada prior to the publication of a consumer standard. Research culminated in 1969 with the publication of 75 CGSB standards specifying ""Canada Standards Sizes"" for children's clothing. Use of these standards is entirely voluntary but the benefits are clear: they help reduce buyer frustration, facilitate ordering by mail or telephone and reduce the need to return clothing because of poor fit. 
Many other far-reaching consumer standards are legislated by government. Legislation regulating WEIGHTS AND MEASURES has been in effect since 1872, when reference was made to British standards. Today's law stipulates that ""all units of measurement in Canada shall be determined on the basis of the International System of Units determined by the General Conference on Weights and Measures,"" although provisions are made for use of the imperial system (see METRIC CONVERSION). The Packaging and Labelling Act specifies that packages for food and nonfood products intended for consumption must carry a label showing the name, nature, volume and weight of the product along with the name and address of the manufacturer. Federal departments of health, agriculture and CONSUMER AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS share responsibilities in administering food standards and FOOD LEGISLATION. Agriculture Canada is responsible for enforcing government standards affecting the quality and condition of agricultural food products and the wholesomeness of meats and meat products. Meats are graded into different classes, thereby indicating that standards have been met. 
HEALTH CANADA is chiefly concerned with enforcing standards specifying the composition and wholesomeness of nonagricultural foods and food products. It also administers the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, which set minimum standards for various products. The Act is intended to protect the public against health hazards and fraud in the sale and use of foods, drugs, cosmetics and medical devices (see SAFETY STANDARDS). Among other things, this exhaustive Act prohibits the sale of foods, drugs or cosmetics manufactured under unsanitary conditions; of any article of food that contains any poisonous or harmful substance; of drugs that do not perform according to prescribed standards; and of cosmetics that may cause injury to health. The Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is responsible for investigating economic fraud concerning food and for administering the packaging, labelling and advertising of food products. "
Copyright;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/copyright-emc;Copyright ProperCopyright. The legal protection given to creators of literary, musical, and artistic works.;"Copyright ProperCopyright. The legal protection given to creators of literary, musical, and artistic works.
The owner of the copyright for a particular literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work has the sole right to reproduce such a work or any substantial part of it in any form, to translate the work, and to perform it or authorize the performance of it in public. The right to reproduce includes the right to make copies of notated music by means of handwriting, printing, photocopying, photography, or other process. While registration is not a requisite of copyright protection, a composer, arranger, or publisher of music may register, for a fee, a work with the Copyright Office of Consumer and Corporate Affairs Canada, in Ottawa. For international protection, however, it is recommended to place a c (for 'copyright') inside a small circle (©) at the bottom of the first page of music, followed by the name of the copyright owner and the year.
If a piece is published, the publisher usually acquires the copyright from the composer in return for the payment of a royalty on each copy sold. Canadian publishers (and self-publishing composers) are obliged to deposit copies of each work immediately after publication in the National Library of Canada (and also, in the province of Quebec, in the BN du Q). The proof-of-publication date indicated by deposit receipts, the listing in the current bibliographies Canadiana and Bibliographie du Québec, and the accessibility to library patrons are obvious benefits of 'legal deposit'. The copyright on a published work extends for 50 years after the composer's death, at which time the composition enters the 'public domain,' ie, it no longer enjoys protection. There are special provisions for works of joint authorship and anonymous or pseudonymous works.
US copyright law differs from Canadian law in many ways. Consideration may be given to registration of copyright with the Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC.
Small rightsThe Canadian Copyright Act guarantees to the copyright owner the sole right to authorize public performances, as do the copyright acts of virtually all other developed countries. These rights are divided into two basic categories, small rights and grand rights.
Small rights cover performances of all musical works unaccompanied by stage action (as opposed to grand rights, which cover performances of large or 'theatrical' works). In order to administer small rights effectively in view of the wide diversification of methods of performance throughout the world, the creators of musical works and their publishers have established special organizations which operate as non-profit collectives for the administration of their rights. These 'performing rights societies,' in Canada, SOCAN - Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada/Société canadienne des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique (formerly CAPAC and PRO Canada) - collects revenue for the public performances and cinema, radio, and TV performances of their members' music; they distribute this revenue on the basis of performance frequency and other criteria. Revenues are also collected through the licensing of restaurants, hotels, concert halls, dance halls, other places of entertainment, broadcasting stations, cinemas, etc. Annually, for the various types of performance, SOCAN proposes tariffs which must be approved by the Copyright Board. Certain exemptions are allowed for performances for educational, religious, and charitable purposes, as interpreted by the courts.
These terms relate to the sole right to authorize or make any device by which copyright musical works may be performed mechanically. Any person or company wishing to produce a recording of such music must obtain a licence from the owner authorizing the mechanical reproduction. The rate is negotiable.
Permission from the copyright owner also must be obtained for the synchronization right, ie, the right to use recorded music protected by copyright in conjunction with a visual medium. The fees vary according to the length of the music and other factors.
In 1976 the CMPA set up the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (Agence canadienne des droits de réproduction musicaux limitée) to administer mechanical and synchronization rights. Most copyright musical works could be cleared through this organization thereafter.
Canada is signatory to two international copyright agreements, the Berne Convention (Rome revision of 1928) and the Universal Copyright Convention (1952). Nearly all countries have subscribed to one or the other, and many, including Canada, to both. Basically each subscribing country undertakes to apply its national copyright laws to the nationals of each other signatory country.
As a result of these two conventions authors are assured of worldwide protection and, inasmuch as the domestic copyright laws of most countries are similar in nature, the creative person is assured of adequate protection on a worldwide scale. Most countries observe a term of copyright for the life of the composer and 50 years following his death.
Since British statutory copyright law goes back to 1710, it is not surprising to find that as early as 1832 the Provincial Statutes of Lower-Canada provided that authors and composers (and their executors, administrators, and legal assigns) had the sole right to print, reprint, publish, and sell their works for a term of 28 years. In 1841 this statute was extended to Upper Canada. In the following year Canadian copyright was extended to residents of the United Kingdom, provided that their works were printed and published in Canada; but it was not until 1850 that Canada imposed a duty on the import, from the USA or continental Europe, of reprints of British copyrights. The registration of a Canadian publication through deposit in the Office of the Registrar of the lower and upper provinces and in the Legislative Library, together with a statement of copyright on the publication itself, was introduced in 1859. (Up to that year only seven musical publications, all hymnbooks, bore copyright notices.) According to Calderisi, Martin Lazare's 'Canadian National Air' (Nordheimer 1859) is the first sheet music with a Canadian copyright notice (many Nordheimer publications had US notices). Maria Stisted's The Rose of Ontario Waltz (Nordheimer 1868) is the first musical item - number seven - in the numerical register of copyrights. The numbering system continued to 42,462 in 1924 and included a large proportion of music. Many of the deposit copies have found their way from the Dept of Agriculture, the first to be charged with copyright administration, to the NL of C and the British Library (see Bibliography entry for information about copyright lists). The fact that only about two-thirds of Canadian music publications of the late 19th century bore copyright notices may be the result of one publisher's trust in his colleagues and in some cases of ignorance of the benefits available.
After the Berne Convention of 1886 a British publisher no longer had to print copies of his music in Canada to prevent US publishers from selling the reprints in Canada. (See Anglo-Canadian Music Company.) The revised Berne Convention of 1908 resulted in the United Kingdom copyright legislation of 1911 (which had some bearing on Canadian practice) and in similar Canadian legislation in 1921. This act protected copyright during the lifetime of an author and for 50 years after his death for published works, and copyright until publication and 50 years thereafter for unpublished works (regardless of whether the author died before publication). The 1921 legislation also introduced the provision for compulsory licensing for the mechanical reproduction of musical works on sound recordings, discussed above. In 1925 the CPRS (Canadian Performing Rights Society, CAPAC from 1945) was formed to administer the royalties of composers and/or lyricists whose works were performed in Canada. A second society, BMI Canada (later PRO Canada, then PROCAN) was established in 1940. A Société du droit de reproduction des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs au Canada (SODRAC), was established in 1985, after operating 1970-85 as SDRM Canada Inc, and the Canadian Reprography Collective was incorporated in 1988.
The Canadian Copyright Act was revised, in part, in 1988, both as part of a lengthy revision process and as a consequence of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the USA. Additional revisions were being contemplated in 1991 to complete the process, particularly in view of the many new technologies for copying and distributing copyright property.
Grand rights cover performances of large works such as operas, operettas, musical shows, oratorios, or ballets. Grand rights must be obtained for each production directly from the copyright owner rather than from a performing rights society which, however, usually is authorized to administer the rights for the performance of individual excerpts from such 'large' works."

(In Britain, ""corn"" is the name for CEREAL CROPS. ) By the 1820s, increased food demands in Britain led to revisions giving preference (lower duties) to colonial over foreign imports, thereby promoting an imperial grain supply. Preferential rates offset the costs of transatlantic transport for British North American grain and built up a major colonial stake in wheat exporting. Shifts in the level of duties primarily to suit British harvests and prices could still trouble this commerce; yet in general it rose steadily, particularly after the CANADA CORN ACT was passed in 1843. Then in 1846 Britain repealed the Corn laws as part of a movement towards free trade. The consequent loss of preferential duties seemed a hard blow to the Canadian grain trade; but it recovered in the prosperous 1850s. Moreover, the lifting of imperial economic controls also brought relief from political controls, and thus imperial recognition of RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT in British North America. "

	 Credit Bureaus provide a credit profile of consumers based on their repayment record of outstanding debts. A credit bureau monitors, with constantly updated information provided by credit card and other lenders, not only whether consumers repay loans but whether they do so regularly and on time. Credit bureaus, unlike investigative agencies, do not assemble information on the lifestyle or character of individuals, or determine whether or not an individual is credit worthy; that is decided by lenders. Credit bureaus merely provide information to help lenders make decisions. Many of Canada's early credit bureaus were organized by merchants in the 1920s as a more efficient means of maintaining information on the credit history of individuals than the prevailing practice of contacting each other to conduct a credit check.


	 There are about 125 credit bureaus in Canada. A national association, the Associated Credit Bureaus of Canada (established 1939) is based in Toronto. There are also provincial associations. The activities of credit bureaus fall under provincial jurisdiction, and legislation in each province allows individuals to know the contents of their credit files and requires credit-granting bodies to advise individuals seeking a loan, a credit card or other financing that their credit history will be checked.

Economic Immigration to Canada;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/immigrant-labour;"Canada’s current and future prosperity depends on recruiting immigrants. Newcomers fill gaps in the Canadian workforce, build or start businesses and invest in the Canadian
	economy. Economic immigrants include employees as well as employers. They mostly become permanent residents when they immigrate to Canada. Not included in this class are the many
	temporary foreign workers who contribute to Canada’s economy.
Economic immigrants bring talent, innovation, family members and financial investments to Canada. They also enrich the country’s culture, heritage and opportunities. Technological progress, productivity and economic growth all benefit from these newcomers.
	Studies show that they have little to no negative impacts on wages for other workers in the country.
The 2016 Census identifies 2,994,130 economic immigrants in Canada. This represents about half of the total of 5,703,615 immigrants counted in that survey. (See also
Immigration to Canada.)";"""Make a Landing on Peace Bridge"" by Morgan on Flickr is licensed under CC BY 2.0.
The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of 2001 lays out Parliament’s goals for Canada’s immigration policy.
	Broadly, immigration policy aims to “support the development of a strong and prosperous Canadian economy.” In this vision, “the benefits of immigration are shared across all regions of Canada.” The federal government	oversees immigration policy, primarily through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). This ministry sets targets for numbers of newcomers and revisits these targets every fall. IRCC consults with industry,
	the provinces and territories, settlement service providers and other partners. (See also Quebec Immigration Policy.)
Economic immigration helps ensure that Canada’s population and labour forces continue to grow. Canada
	has an aging population and low fertility rates (i.e., the number of children born per woman). One in five Canadians is foreign-born, the highest rate among the G7 countries. Immigrants make up about 71 per cent of Canada’s population growth. In 2018–19,
	Canada’s population growth rate was 1.4 per cent, the highest among the G7 countries. Immigration was the source of most of that increase. By the year 2040, immigrants will likely drive all of Canada’s population growth. Economic immigrants are generally
	younger than the Canadian-born population. Because of this, economic immigration lessens the aging of Canada’s labour force. In 1971, Canada had 6.6 people of working age for each senior citizen. By 2012, the worker-to-retiree ratio dropped to 4.2 to
	1. Projections put the ratio at 2 to 1 by 2036, when five million Canadians are set to retire.
In a global market, Canada is competing to attract talent. Other industrialized countries, like the United States, seek skilled immigrants. So do emerging markets like Brazil
	and India. In 2005, 22 per cent of countries had policies aimed at quickly resettling highly skilled immigrants. By 2015, this proportion had doubled to 44 per cent.
Economic immigration is one of several immigration categories. As a pathway to residence in Canada, it is distinct from family reunification and refugee	and humanitarian protection status. Before moving to Canada and taking a job, immigrants must apply for a permanent residence visa from IRCC. Canada has a points-based system for selecting labour immigrants. This system prioritizes human capital,
	Canadian education and job offers.
The Canadian government introduced the first points-based system in 1967. (See Immigration to Canada).
	It updated this system in 1993 after a massive backlog of applications led to wait times of more than five years.
The government implemented the electronic Express Entry system in 2015. Express Entry fast-tracks skilled immigrants with Canadian work experience or pre-arranged employment. It draws more and more on temporary workers and international students already
	in the country (see Canada's Temporary Foreign Worker Programs). Express Entry provides three major pathways for highly skilled
	workers to immigrate to Canada. (Examples of highly skilled workers are doctors, computer programmers and architects.)
Pathway
Who it’s for
Federal Skilled Worker Program
Skilled workers with foreign work experience who want to immigrate to Canada permanently.
Federal Skilled Trades Program
Skilled workers who want to become permanent residents.
Canadian Experience Class
Skilled workers who have Canadian work experience and want to become permanent residents.
Would-be immigrants fill out applications to enter a pool of candidates wishing to move to Canada. Express Entry’s point system uses a matrix of several factors to rank these applications. It accounts for skills, work experience, language ability and
	education. The system may award points for other factors, such as having a sibling or a job offer in Canada. IRCC prioritizes these factors because they potentially enhance an immigrant’s ability to integrate quickly into Canadian society and to contribute
	to the economy. IRCC then issues a certain number of visas to those selected to move to Canada. This number depends on its pre-set yearly targets.
Many see Express Entry as a more objective assessment than other countries’ migration management systems. This is because Express Entry draws on observable characteristics. It notably replaced the previous first-come, first-served system that had frustrated
	many people. The less predictable former system would speed admissions up or slow them down depending on the economy. Champions of the current Canadian point system say it is free
	of prejudice. They cite the fact that a person’s ethnic background or country of origin plays no part in the selection process.
Nevertheless, scholars note several challenges to equity and justice with Express Entry and the points-based system.
First, selection does not equal a job. Canada admits more highly skilled immigrants than it can quickly move into the workplace. One major cause of this gap is that Canada does not recognize many credentials obtained abroad. This is notably true in
	medical, dental and veterinary	fields. When faced with this problem, newcomers are unable to apply the skills and education for which they were chosen. They must either do other work or go back to school. Many therefore take “survival jobs” but do not reach personal or career fulfillment
	in Canada. Capacity in either of Canada’s official languages may pose a separate or additional barrier to using one’s skills in Canada. Sometimes immigrants may appear less skilled compared to the general population, but this gap closes over time as
	their English and/or French language acquisition improves.
Second, it takes time and money to immigrate. Processing times for applications are still quite long. The administrative fees are barriers for many people. These fees are also non-refundable with no guarantee of success.
Finally, under a policy known as medical inadmissibility, IRCC will reject some candidates due to their own or their children’s medical issues. This policy is roundly criticized as discriminatory and ableist."
Employment Insurance;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/employment-insurance;"Employment Insurance (formerly Unemployment Insurance) is a government program that provides temporary benefit payments during a period of unemployment. The Employment Insurance
	(EI) program also provides illness, parental and caregiving benefits for persons who are away from work due to health and family-related reasons. EI is financed by premiums paid by employers and employees. The program is overseen by the Canada
	Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC). In July 2021, approximately 1.5 million Canadians received EI benefits.";"As early as 1919 the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations had recommended a national program of unemployment insurance, but when the R.B. Bennett government
	tried to introduce the Employment and Social Insurance Act in 1935, the Supreme Court of Canada and the Privy Council of Great Britain declared the Act unconstitutional on the grounds that it was an infringement of provincial authority.
Unemployment rates grew during the Great Depression and by 1933, 30 percent of the labour force was without work. The unemployment rate remained high at 12 per cent until the start of the Second World War.
	 The Great Depression and the mobilization effort of the Second World War hastened the adoption of unemployment insurance. The first compulsory national unemployment
	insurance program was instituted on 7 August 1940 after a constitutional amendment gave the federal government legislative power over unemployment insurance. The Unemployment Insurance Act came into effect on 1 July 1941. In 1996 the
	Unemployment Insurance system was renamed Employment Insurance (EI).
As of 1990, the fund has been financed by contributions shared by employees and employers. EI premiums are deducted from an employee’s insurable earnings. An employer contributes 1.4 times employee rate.
To qualify for regular EI benefits, applicants must show that they were previously employed for the required insurable hours in the last 52 weeks or since the start of their previous EI claim. To receive benefits, they must file a claim stating that
	they are without work, are willing to work and are ready and capable of working. Following a waiting period of 1 week (new claims only), individuals are eligible to receive 55 per cent of average weekly insured earnings. As of 1 January 2021, a
	person could receive a maximum amount of $595 per week. The number of weeks for which benefits can be claimed varies, depending on the length of previous employment, previous employment insurance claims, and the regional unemployment rate.
The employment insurance system is an important component of the economic safety net provided by government and it has provided greater income security for Canadians.  "
Equalization Payments;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/equalization-payments;Equalization payments are payments that the federal government makes to the poorer provinces. The monies come from Ottawa's general revenues and are unconditional transfers that can be spent as the recipient provinces please (see also TRANSFER PAYMENT).;"Equalization payments are payments that the federal government makes to the poorer provinces. The monies come from Ottawa's general revenues and are unconditional transfers that can be spent as the recipient provinces please (see also TRANSFER PAYMENT). Their purpose is to reduce the horizontal imbalance among the provinces. 
In general, 2 kinds of fiscal imbalance can arise in a federation - vertical and horizontal. The former is an imbalance between the 2 levels of government, federal and provincial, eg, when the responsibilities of the provinces are disproportionately large compared with their share of revenues. Such an imbalance can be remedied by a transfer of responsibilities to the federal government (eg, family allowances and EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE) or by a transfer of revenues from Ottawa to the provinces. By contrast, horizontal imbalance is a fiscal imbalance among the provinces themselves - the fact that some provinces have more sources of revenue and are therefore richer than other provinces. Equalization payments can help adjust these horizontal imbalances. 
The Constitution Act of 1982 states ""Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services and reasonably comparable levels of taxation."" The concept of equalization can be traced to the statutory subsidies in the CONSTITUTION ACT, 1867, and more recently to the National Adjustment Grants recommended by the Royal Commission on DOMINION-PROVINCIAL RELATIONS as part of an overall reorganization of federal-provincial financial arrangements (see also INTERGOVERNMENTAL FINANCE; FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL RELATIONS). 
The first formal equalization program was introduced in 1957. The transfers were designed to ensure that per-capita revenues of all provinces from shared taxes (see TAXATION) - personal income taxes, corporate income taxes and succession duties - matched those of the wealthiest provinces, at that time BC and Ontario. 
In the first of the required 5-year revisions, the level up to which these transfers were equalized became the all-province average, rather than matching the wealthiest 2 provinces. As compensation, the recipient provinces were also guaranteed revenues equal to 50% of the all-province per-capita average of resource revenues. Throughout this time equalization payments rose, largely because the federal government transferred increasing proportions of the personal income tax to the provinces; from 10% in 1957 to 24% by 1967. 
The comprehensive nature of the current equalization program dates from 1967. In effect, most of the categories of revenues collected by the provinces were equalized to the national average level. With one major exception (energy) and with some modifications, eg, increasing the number of revenue sources included, the system remained unchanged until 1982. Canada's equalization program became the most comprehensive and most generous in the world. 
However, problems began to develop in 1973 with the increase in world energy prices. Maintaining full equalization of energy revenues and increasing domestic energy prices would have meant a tripling of total equalization flows and the inclusion of Ontario as a recipient province. Temporary steps were adopted in 1973-74 to reduce the impact of energy on the system and in the 1977 revision only 50% of resource revenues was eligible for equalization. In spite of this modification, Ontario still qualified for equalization payments over the 1977-82 period and was retroactively excluded from receiving payments by what has come to be known as the ""personal income override,"" ie, essentially, no province whose per-capita income exceeds the national-average level is eligible for equalization. 
In the 1982 version of the program, provinces are eligible to receive sufficient equalization to raise their revenues from all provincial and local revenue sources to a level that is calculated by applying national average tax rates to the average per capita tax bases of 5 designated provinces (Ontario, Québec, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and BC). As a result, Ontario will no longer qualify for payments and energy revenues will have less impact on equalization flows, chiefly because Alberta is not one of the 5 provinces. 
The scheduled 1987 revision of the equalization formula has effectively been postponed for a year or two. Part of this relates to the proposed tax reform measures. Since taxation will shift from income toward consumption, this may require significant alterations in the formula. Moreover, the proposed federal day-care program contains shared-cost measures that cover 90% of costs for Newfoundland and only 50% of Ontario. This represents a major departure in that we are now embarked on expenditure-side equalization, which in turn may influence the negotiations on the revenue-equalization formula. 
The 1985 Atlantic Accord on energy (with Newfoundland and Labrador) and the 1986 Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resource Accord gives these 2 provinces a sort of special status with respect to equalization. Carried to the extreme, this would move equalization away from a formula-based system and toward a bilateral approach. Thus, the forthcoming negotiations might constitute a watershed in the evolution of equalization payments. "
Law of Fiduciary Obligation;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/law-of-fiduciary-obligation;"In Canadian law, fiduciary obligation refers to a relationship in which one party (the fiduciary) is responsible for looking after the best interests of another party (the beneficiary). The courts have determined that a fiduciary obligation exists where
	the fiduciary can exercise some discretion or power, and they do so in a way that affects the interests of the beneficiary. In these relationships, the beneficiary is in a position of vulnerability at the hands of the fiduciary.
";"The legal system recognizes many special relationships in which one party is required to look after the best interests of the other in the best possible way. These relationships are called fiduciary relationships. They include solicitor/client, physician/patient,
	priest/parishioner, parent/child, partner/partner, director/corporation and principal/agent relationships. Fiduciary relationships involve trust and confidence. They require that the fiduciary (i.e., the party entrusted with taking care of another party)
	acts honestly, in good faith, and strictly in the best interests of the other party (i.e., the beneficiary).

Fiduciary relationships emerge from the reasonable expectations of the parties, often in circumstances where one person relies on the other, to protect his or her interests. They frequently involve explicit or implicit commitments by one party to look
	after the interests of the other. Even relationships where the parties are expected to pursue their own self-interest can, in appropriate circumstances, be fiduciary. There are several cases where banks have been regarded as fiduciaries of their customers.

Usually, fiduciaries have power or influence over the economic, legal or practical interests of beneficiaries, who are somewhat vulnerable. There is a debate in the law about whether beneficiaries must be vulnerable, and if so, the extent of vulnerability
	they must have in order to benefit from this area of law. Some federal and provincial corporate law statutes contain provisions that arguably make fiduciary obligations in the corporate world a matter of statute.

Breach of fiduciary duty is a serious violation. Stringent remedial rules are used to put beneficiaries in the position they would have been in had there not been a breach of fiduciary duty. The beneficiary will be compensated for any losses flowing from
	the breach, such as a loss of an investment, or physical and mental suffering flowing from sexual or other abuse. Any profit that was improperly obtained by the fiduciary will be given to the beneficiary. Fiduciaries in breach of duty are more likely
	to have punitive damages (a type of punishment) awarded against them than are ordinary defendants. Fiduciary obligations can continue even after any contractual relationship between the fiduciary and the beneficiary has ended.

Ordinarily, fiduciaries cannot take advantage of opportunities that will profit them in some way because of their role in the relationship. There are demanding rules that prohibit both profit making and any conflict of interest that goes beyond what is
	necessary to the relationship. Secret benefits in the form of undisclosed kickbacks, commissions and profits, conflicts of interest, and discounts are strictly prohibited. An improper benefit is usually financial, but can include virtually any form of
	improper personal gain.

A fiduciary cannot ordinarily buy from or sell anything to a beneficiary, cannot ordinarily refer the beneficiary to a business in which the fiduciary has an interest, and, in many cases, cannot without suspicion be the recipient of a gift from a beneficiary.
	Fiduciaries like physicians cannot conduct research without disclosing to their patients that they are doing research. Fiduciaries who in any way physically or sexually abuse their beneficiaries are guilty of a particularly grievous form of breach of
	fiduciary duty.

The Crown has a fiduciary obligation toward Indigenous
peoples. The Royal
Proclamation of 1763 established the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous people, and outlines that the Crown must act only in the interests of Indigenous people. In other words, the Crown must behave in accordance with fiduciary
	duty. After the Guerin
case, fiduciary duty became central to Section 35 of the Constitution
Act, 1982, which enshrines protections for Indigenous
rights. (See also Aboriginal
Title.)

The Crown also owes Indigenous peoples the duty to
consult. This is a legal obligation that must be fulfilled by the Crown prior to taking actions or making decisions that may have consequences for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada.

Mining Safety and Health;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mining-safety-and-health;Like most industrial activities, mining involves risk. However, contemporary mining in Canada is much safer than it once was. ;"
Like most industrial activities, mining involves risk. However, contemporary mining in Canada is much safer than it once was. The old image of miners with picks and shovels no longer holds true. Many contemporary miners use robotics, computers and high-tech equipment, making mining as safe or safer than comparable heavy industrial activities such as construction, logging or even farming. (See also Coal Mining Disasters; Safety Standards.)


	    Hazards are inherent to working with heavy equipment, explosives and large vehicles. This is particularly so in open-pit mining, in which high-voltage electrical power is supplied to mobile equipment, such as draglines and shovels. There is also a risk of rocks flying through the air during large-scale blasting operations. Underground mining involves working in confined space with restricted illumination. Noise, engine exhaust emissions, mineral dusts and gases are also hazards, especially underground. The latter pose additional hazards in coal mining when methane is released from the rock strata. Within a certain range of concentration in the atmosphere (between 5 and 15 per cent), methane is highly explosive. Accidents are often devastating, causing much damage and loss of life.


	    Miners might also fall or be struck by pieces of falling rock. Falls by miners can be reduced by increased attention on the work and surroundings, by safer working practices and by training. Rock falls are being reduced in frequency by better blasting practices, by the immediate removal (or scaling) of potentially hazardous slabs or blocks of loosened rock, and by rock reinforcement. The common practice is to never walk beneath rock that has not been inspected, scaled and bolted. The science of rock mechanics and its practical counterpart, ground control, are used to ensure that the design of mine openings takes into account the geological features, the strengths of the rocks, and the local stresses in the rock mass. Historically, this level of mine engineering did not take place.


	    In mining, continuous improvements are being made in equipment, working practices and protective gear, with a view toward enhancing the working environment. Sensors are used to detect the performance characteristics of equipment, various gases in the mine atmosphere and movements in the rock.


	    In Canada, mining health and safety is mostly the responsibility of the provincial and territorial governments. Each province and territory has its own legislation and a Chief Inspector of Mines. The federal government is responsible for certain federally owned mines in the provinces and, through the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, for uranium mines.

Movement of Dangerous Goods;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/movement-of-dangerous-goods;Some materials and products that move by rail, ship, air or highway within Canada or across our national boundaries are classified as dangerous goods because they are flammable, explosive, toxic or potentially harmful to people or the ENVIRONMENT.

Until 1985 their movement was not well regulated.
Regulations Several well-published incidents involving dangerous goods, which forced the evacuation of thousands of people or necessitated millions of dollars' worth of environmental cleanup work, led the federal government to introduce the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, whose regulations became effective in Ontario 1 July 1985, and in the rest of Canada 1 February 1986. The Act was revised in June 1992 and amended again in 2009.
The 2009 amendments to the Act put in place a comprehensive security (terrorist) prevention and response program just like the one that currently exists for accidental releases.
Classification  Each dangerous good is classified into one of 9 hazard classes defined in the Act. Once the product is classified, manufacturers, shippers and transporters of dangerous goods are responsible for proper packaging, labelling and handling. Violation of the regulations can result in fines of up to $100 000. 
Documentation Documentation identifying the dangerous goods being transported must be prepared by the shipper. In the event of an incident during transport, this ensures the contents can be readily identified and appropriate actions taken. 
Cargo Tank Standards As of 1 July 1995, all cargo tanks used for the transportation of dangerous goods must be designed, constructed, inspected and certified as complying with a Canadian standard for the transport of the dangerous goods. These standards continue to be reviewed and updated within a 5-year cycle.
Emergency Response Assistance Plans Shippers and importers of particularly hazardous dangerous goods are required to have an emergency response assistance plan approved by Transport Canada. These plans are designed to ensure that appropriate technical expertise and equipment are available to first responders in the event of an incident involving these products. If a release occurs, the appropriate authorities must be notified.

National Energy Program;https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/national-energy-program;"The National Energy Program (NEP) was an energy policy of the government of Canada from 1980
	through 1985. Its goal was to ensure that Canada could supply its own oil and gas needs by
	1990. The NEP was initially popular with consumers and as a symbol of Canadian economic nationalism. However, private industry	and some provincial governments opposed it.
A federal-provincial deal resolved controversial parts of the NEP in 1981. Starting the next year, however, the program was dismantled in phases. Global economic conditions had changed such that the NEP was no longer considered necessary or useful. The
	development of the oil sands and offshore drilling, as well as the rise in Western alienation and the development of the modern Conservative Party of Canada,
	are all aspects of the NEP’s complicated legacy.";"Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau (right) and Alberta premier Peter Lougheed (centre) at a news conference to announce an oil pricing agreement, 1 September 1981.
Protectionism The practice of protecting the industries of a country by restricting foreign competition in their home market. (See Protectionism.)
Price controls Restrictions that a government sets on the price of specific goods. Price controls are usually a short-term measure to control the affordability of the goods.
The federal government had been involved in regulating and developing the Canadian oil and
	gas industry since the early 1960s. From 1961 to 1973, the government maintained a protected market for Western Canadian oil to help the industry grow. Two major oil
	crises in the 1970s encouraged the federal government to secure oil resources for Canadian consumers by taking a more active role in developing the Canadian oil and gas sector. (See Oil and Gas Policy in Canada, 1947–80.)
	The National Energy Program was the policy guiding this role.
The National Energy Program (NEP) had three main objectives:
Accomplishing these goals would make Canada energy-independent. The nation would no longer depend on foreign oil imports	nor be affected by changes in the world price of oil. The NEP would guarantee Canadian consumers access to made-in-Canada oil and gas at set prices. It was also designed to increase revenue for the federal government.
To accomplish these goals, the NEP required much more federal government involvement in the energy sector. The government would encourage exploration	and provide new funding for research and development. New taxes and price controls
	were introduced. The NEP encouraged greater local participation in the oil industry. It also aimed to conserve oil by helping consumers switch from oil to natural gas and electricity for home heating.
This kind of economic nationalism and direct intervention in the economy was not new in Canada. The country had developed Crown corporations	to play a variety of economic and policy roles earlier in the 20th century. Crown corporations had grown in number during the Second World War.
	And while Canada’s economy had become less centrally controlled after the Second World War, the government remained involved in certain industries throughout much of the Cold War.
	These industries included a national railway and airline, in addition to aerospace manufacturers, telecommunications	networks, nuclear power generation and uranium mining, among many others. 
The NEP was controversial for several reasons.
First, natural resources such as oil and gas	traditionally fell to the provinces. Premiers such as Peter Lougheed of Alberta thought such a major change in Canada’s energy policy	should have involved provincial consultation. He and others feared the provinces would lose an important source of revenue.
	
 Complicating this situation was the fact that federal-provincial relations were being tested in the early 1980s. Quebec	held a referendum on sovereignty just five months before the NEP was introduced (see Quebec Referendum (1980)).
	Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau promised constitutional negotiations between
	the provinces and the federal government to develop a new made-in-Canada constitution and
	charter of rights. Negotiations over the constitution and the NEP dominated Canadian politics throughout 1981. Trudeau pushed for a strong federal government
	and a program of nation-building projects and policies. Meanwhile, premiers (including Lougheed and Quebec’s René Lévesque) wanted a looser association where the provinces
	had greater control over their own affairs.
A second source of controversy was the NEP’s price controls. Though price fairness benefited all Canadian consumers, it also limited the profits of private industry and the royalties
	paid to oil-producing provinces.
Finally, the NEP was based on the idea that access to cheap oil and gas was more of a public need than a free-market commodity. While the free market is driven by the
	quest for profit, the NEP was driven by the need to keep consumer costs as low as possible. These interests tend to be at odds with one another.
Like the other energy policies that had come before it, the NEP was subject to provincial-federal negotiations. The federal government	and the governments of the oil-producing provinces agreed to an amended version of the NEP in 1981. The compromise involved the federal government agreeing to modify price controls and regulations. In turn, the provinces agreed that the federal government
	had a right to special taxes designed to increase federal revenue and Canadian energy independence.
Cartoon by Len Norris for the 1 September 1981 edition of the Vancouver Sun.
As the global price of oil declined from 1983 to 1985, federal and provincial governments continued to negotiate changes to the NEP to help private industry. By 1984–85, the economic
	conditions that had led to the creation of NEP no longer existed. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney	proposed a new energy policy during his first term in office. The new policy aimed to address the important changes in the global oil market. The Western Accord on Energy went into effect on 1 June 1985, ending the NEP and more than 20 years of federal
	government protectionism and regulation of the oil and gas industry."

	   The Navigation Acts were a complex set of British laws dating from 1651 and 1660, regulating British and later imperial shipping and trade to foster economic and naval power (see mercantilism). They governed ownership and crew nationality of vessels trading to Britain and her colonies, and the acceptability of routes and commodities. They were used to try to link British North America economically with the West Indian colonies; more generally, trade among BNA colonies and theirs with Britain had to be conducted in British or colonial vessels. Trade on the Great Lakes did not entirely fit the system; enforcement was lax before 1815 and by 1822 legislation permitted cross-lake trade in many commodities. Following repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, Canadians resentfully denounced the Acts as a burden. They were repealed in 1849 as part of Britain's overall movement to free trade.

	It began in 1972 as a response to a series of crises that farmers faced due to decreasing prices for these products.";"(""Four litre bagged milk, Quebec"" by incommunicado on Wikimedia Commons (via Flickr) is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.)
Farm-gate price — The price of a farmer’s product at the “gate” of the farm, i.e., before transportation or delivery costs.
Tariff — A tax on imported goods and services that’s designed to make these products more expensive.


Tariffs on imports protect a significant share of the Canadian market for Canadian farmers. These tariffs have run as high as 300 per cent. Some duty-free imports are permitted
	under quotas negotiated with trading partners. But the bulk of the Canadian market is reserved for Canadian farmers.
The current supply management system came into effect in early 1972 under the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act. That law was renamed the Farm Products Agencies Act in 1993. Lawmakers passed the Act in response to a series of crises
	in the 1960s. In these crises, thousands of farmers had found themselves largely helpless in striking fair prices for their products. Some processors and supermarkets had used their power to drive down the prices they paid farmers. This had led to highly
	volatile markets and costly federal support payments to farmers.
The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee implements the National Milk Marketing Plan. The Canadian Dairy Commission, a federal crown corporation established in 1966,
	chairs this committee. In the early 1970s, dairy became the first commodity to have a
	national supply system in Canada. Organizations representing other commodities quickly followed with their own systems: Egg Farmers of Canada (1972), Turkey Farmers of Canada (1974), Chicken Farmers of Canada (1978) and Canadian Hatching Eggs Producers
	(1986). (See also Agricultural Marketing Board.)
Supporters of supply management argue that the system assures farmers of a fair price. They also maintain that it gives farmers the stability they need to make investments in their businesses. Such investments can promote the productivity and health of
	farms and the safety of their products. At the same time, these investments can strengthen Canada’s rural communities. The stability of supply management avoids the boom-and-bust cycles found in the United States, where taxpayer subsidies are a feature
	of the dairy industry and where farm bankruptcies and bailouts are not uncommon. Under supply
	management, there is no need for taxpayer bailouts or subsidies.
Critics say that supply management forces Canadian consumers to pay higher prices because it does not allow the competition of free markets. (The price the farmer gets is, however, only a small proportion of what consumers end up paying.) Critics also
	contend that the need to defend supply management can hamper Canada’s ability to gain other concessions in trade negotiations. The United States, in particular, continues
	to press Canada to end its supply management system. But defenders of the system point out that this would allow US farmers to dump their excess production into Canada. Such dumping would drive many Canadian farmers out of business."
